Ideas for future Python meetings:

1    How to install Python? What are the different ways of doing so?
2   Intro to Python
3    Discuss some of the basics of Python
4    MatLab to Python: ways to transition
5    Share a solution to a problem in own work
6    Walk through problems in a script together
7    Sharing Python insights
8    Use mailing list to help each other with problems
9    De-bug code
10    GUI in Python?
11   Data logging over serial coms
12    How to use Iris/CF
13   Changing data formats using Python
14    Plotting (e.g. MatPlotLib, Cartopy)
15    Working with NetCDF data formats
16    Using MatPlotLib for plotting
17    Working through simple tasks (e.g. plotting a graph) together and comparing different ways of performing that task
18   How to make scripts more efficient
19    Various ways to plot 3D graphics

The idea is that we discuss topics/features and share knowledge etc. with each other in an informal and interactive manner. These Python sessions rely on your input and participation. They are an opportunity for you to expand your Python skills!
