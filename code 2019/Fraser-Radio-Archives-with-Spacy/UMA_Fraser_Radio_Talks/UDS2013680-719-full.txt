ELECTORATE TALK FOR SUN DAY, 25 OCTOBER 1981

A PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN THE SINAI IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF 
THE EGYPT/ISRAEL PEACE TREATY,

THIS TREATY, WHICH REQUIRES ISRAEL TO MOVE OUT OF THE SINAI 
PENINSULA COMPLETELY BY NEXT APRIL

 - WAS ACHIEVED AFTER 30 YEARS OF UNREMITTING BITTERNESS
   AND FIGHTING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

IN VIEW OF THE DISTRUST WHICH 30 YEARS OF ENMITY HAS INEVITABLY 
BRED

 - IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE TW0 COUNTRIES, AT THE
   TIME WHEN THEY MADE THE PEACE TREATY, ADMITTED THAT 
   A PEACEKEEPING FORCE WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE THE 
   TREATY WORK,

AND LET ME EMPHASISE THAT IT IS A PEACEKEEPING FORCE

 - NOT A FIGHTING FORCE, BUT A GROUP OF MILITARY PERSONNEL
   WHO WILL BE THERE TO OBSERVE AND MO!JITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION 
   OF THE PEACE ACCORDS BY THE PARTIES WHO HAVE THEMSELVES 
   MADE THE PEACE.

          2.


THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING THE TREATY WORK HAS BEEN MADE GREATER 
BY THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT SADAT

 - BUT HIS SUCCESSOR IS DETERMINED TO PURSUE THE SAME
   PEACE POLICY.

IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A MORE PERMANENT PEACE, EGYPT AND ISRAEL 
BOTH WANT A PEACEKEEPING FORCE TO BE ESTABLISHED

 - AND THEY BOTH WANT AUSTRALIA TO BE PART OF IT.

A UNITED NATIONS SPONSORED PEACEKEEPING FORCE WOULD OBVIOUSLY 
BE THE BEST OPTION

 - AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE OPPOSED
   AUSTRALIA PLAYING A PART IF A U.N. FORCE HAD BEEN 
   POSSIBLE.

BUT THE FACT IS THAT A U.N. SPONSORED FORCE IS SIMPLY NOT 
AN OPTION

 - THE SOVIET UNION WOULD HAVE VETOED IT AS THEY VETOED
   THE CONTINUATION OF AN EARLIER PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN 
   1979. 

WE CANNOT ALLOW THE SOVIET UNION TO VETO GENUINE PEACEKEEPING 
EFFORTS AROUND THE WORLD.

                3,




THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE UNITED NATIONS MIGHT BE PREVENTED 

FROM LENDING ITS WEIGHT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PEACEKEEPING 
FORCE WAS FORESEEN AT THE TIME OF THE PEACE TREATY


  - AND THAT IS WHY THERE WAS PROVISION IN THE PEACE

    TREATY ACCORDS FOR THE UNITED STATES, WHOSE PRESIDENT 
    HAD PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE TREATY


  - TO TAKE STEPS TO ESTABLISH A PEACEKEEPING FORCE IF

    THE UNITED NATIONS DID NOT DO S0,


THE MIDDLE EAST IS A REGION OF VAST STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE 
FOR AUSTRALIA AS IT IS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD.


IT IS A VOLATILE REGION



  - AND NO OTHER PEACE PROPOSALS APART FROM THOSE WHICH
    CAME OUT OF CAMP DAVID HAVE EVER GOT OFF THE GROUND,


THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS ARE NOT A SOLUTION TO ALL THE PROBLEMS 

OF THE MIDDLE EAST



  - BUT IT IS SURELY ABSURD TO IMAGINE THAT ONE SINGLE
    PACKAGE SOLUTION COULD EVER BE FOUND TO ALL THOSE 
    PROBLEMS.

THERE IS NO CONCRETE PLAN FOR PEACE, OTHER THAN THE CAMP 
DAVID ACCORDS, ANYWHERE ON THE HORIZON

  - AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS EVERY REASON TO
    SUPPOSE THAT THE EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI PEACE TREATY 
    WILL BREAK DOWN WITHOUT THE ESTABLISHME'!T OF 
    THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED PEACEKEEPING FORCE

  - SURELY MEANS THAT THIS PEACEKEEPING FORCE SHOULD
    BE ESTABLISHED TO UNDERTAKE ITS MONITORING ROLE,

THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AUSTRALIA SHOULD PARTICIPATE WAS 
UNDER ACTIVE CONSIDERATIO9 BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR MONTHS

  - BECAUSE THERE WERE WEIGHTY CONSIDERATIONS ON BOTH
    SIDES OF THE BALANCE

  - BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE DECISION THAT AUSTRALIA
    IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE ON THE TERMS WHICH I 
    ANNOUNCED IN THE PARLIAMENT ON THURSDAY IS
    RIGHT FOR AUSTRALIA, AND FOR THE CAUSE OF PEACE.

THIS DECISION MEANS THAT WE WILL PARTICIPATE IF CANADA AND 
BRITAIN PARTICIPATE

  - ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS HOPEFUL THAT OTHER
    EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE APPARENTLY 
    RECOJSIDERING THEIR POSITIONS, MIGHT EQUALLY TAKE PART.

                 5.


    THE DECISION ALSO MEANS THAT THE EXTENT AND DURATION OF 
    AUSTRALIA'S COMMITMENT WILL BE DEFINED IN ADVANCE

     - AND THIS GETS RID OF THE FEAR WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE
       EXPRESSED ABOUT AN OPEN-ENDED COMMITMENT.

    THE DECISION ALSO MEANS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN COMMANDER WOULD 
    RETAIN THE ULTIMATE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH AUSTRALIAN 
    AUTHORITIES BEFORE COMPLYING WITH ORDERS WHICH HE BELIEVED 
    WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE AGREED PURPOSES OF THE FORCE.

    NO PART OF THE PEACEKEEPING FORCE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSOCIATION
WITH THE U.S. RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE

     - AND OUR PARTICIPATION WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE CONDITIONAL
       ON CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE TREATY FROM EGYPT 
       AND ISRAEL,

    THE DECISION WE HAVE MADE THEREFORE PROTECTS AUSTRALIA'S 
    I NTERESTS

     - IT PROVIDES THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SECURITY FOR
       AUSTRALIAN PERSONNEL

     - AND ITS TERMS ARE SUCH THAT EVERY SIGNIFICANT BARRIER
       THAT WAS SEEN IN THE WAY OF AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT IN 
       THE PEACEKEEPING FORCE IS AVOIDED.

•




    IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THOSE WHO SEEK PEACE TO SIT BACK 
    AND LEAVE IT To OTHERS TO ACHIEVE,

    THE HISTORY OF OUR OWN CENTURY SHOWS ALL TOO PLAINLY THAT 
    WHEN THAT PASSIVE COURSE IS ADOPTED

     - PEACE GOES BY DEFAULT

     - AND THE WORLD CAN FALL INTO WAR,

    SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK THE QUESTION "WHY AUSTRALIA?", THE VERY 
    SIMPLE ANSWER IS

     - BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED FOR PEACE,

    IT IS MY HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE PEACEKEEPING 
    FORCE IS ESTABLISHED

     - SO THAT IT CAN START ITS WORK AND THUS HELP ADVANCE 
       THE CAUSE OF PEACE.
