PRIVE MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK

SUNDAY, 4 JULY 1952

THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION RECENTLY ANNOUNCED COMMONWEALTH 
EDUCATION FUNDING FOR 1983 OF ALMOST $3,000 MILLION,

SINCE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION POLICY, AND IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT SCHOOL 
FUNDING, IN A BROADER CONTEXT,

THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE 
NATION'S RESOURCES TO EDUCATION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
     SUCH THAT $7,000 MILLION WAS SPENT BY COMMONWEALTH AND 
     STATE GOVERNMENTS ON EDUCATION IN 1980-81.

THE VERY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY PROVIDED FOR THE EDUCATION OF 
AUSTRALIANS UNDERLINES THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING SUPPORT 
FOR EDUCATION AS A PRIORITY COMMITMENT,

WITHIN THIS TOTAL ALLOCATION, THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT BY THE 
COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS HAS EXPANDED 
SUBSTANTIALLY,

THE LATEST AVAILABLE FIGURES, FOR 1979/80, SHOW THAT JUST UNDER 
$5,000 MILLION WAS SPENT BY BOTH COMMONWEALTH AND STATE 
GOVERNMENTS ON ALL SCHOOLS;

   - AN AMOUNT ALMOST TWO-THIRDS HIGHER IN REAL TERMS
     THAN THAT RECORDED IN 1971/72.

            -2-

SINCE 1979/80 COMMONWEALTH AND STATE EXPENDITURE HAS CONTINUED 
TO INCREASE.

WHILE THE STATES PROVIDE ABOUT 90% OF FUNDS FOR GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS

     AND HAVE TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ADMINISTRATION

   - THE COMMONWEALTH ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN
     SUPPLEMENTING STATE EFFORTS,

COvMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE DIRECTED TOWARDS SCHOOLS 
HAS EXPANDED OVER RECENT YEARS.

   - IT IS OVER 7.0% HIGHER IN REAL TERMS THIS YEAR THAN
     IT WAS IN 1976,

IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT FOR 1983 THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S 
ALLOCATION TO EDUCATION INCLUDES A REAL INCREASE OF TWO PERCENT 
IN GENERAL RECURRENT FUNDING FOR GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS

   - AND ALMOST 95% OF THE INCREASE FOR NON-GOVERNMENT
     SCHOOLS WILL BE DIRECTED TO THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED,

TO PUT A PROPER PERSPECTIVE ON THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
FOR EDUCATION, IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT THE EARLIER FINDINGS OF
A SPECIAL COMMITTEE - KNOWN AS THE KARMEL COMMITTEE - SET UP
IN 1972 TO RECOMMEND APPROPRIATE TARGET FUNDING LEVELS FOR
ALL SCHOOLS TO BE ACHIEI'ED BY 1979.

            -3-

THESE TARGETS WERE MET FOR GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IN MOST STATES 
THREE YEARS EARLIER THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED,

I WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT FOR A MOMENT ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THIS COMMITMENT BY GOVERNMENT AND WHAT IT MEANS AT THE 
STUDENT LEVEL,

TOTAL COMMONWEALTH AND STATE RECURRENT EXPENDITURE IN 1979/80 
ON GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AMOUNTED Y OVER $1,700 PER PUPIL, 
HAVING STEADILY INCREASED BY 68% IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1971/72,

AND AVERAGE CLASS SIZES HAVE FALLEN,

IN 1971, FOR EXAMPLE, IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS THERE WERE ABOUT 
22 STUDENTS FOR EVERY TEACHER,

BY 1981 THESE RATIOS HAD FALLEN SO THAT THERE WERE ABOUT 16 
STUDENTS ON AVERAGE FOR EVERY TEACHER,

DESPITE THE IMPROVED STUDENT RATIOS; DESPITE THE FACT THAT ON 
AVERAGE GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS HAVE BETTER STUDENT-TEACHER RATIOS 
THAN NON GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS;

DESPITE MORE DOLLARS ON AVERAGE GOING INTO GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS 
PER STUDENT;

  - THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED SHIFT IN ENROLMENTS AWAY FROM
    GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IN RECENT TIMES.

IN THE THREE YEARS TO 1951, TOTAL ENROLMENTS AT GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS 

FELL BY 2.5%, WHILE TOTAL ENROLMENTS AT NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS 

ROSE BY 7,5%,




INDEED, EXCEPT FOR A SMALL DECLINE IN PRIMARY ENROLMENTS AT 

NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS BETWEEN 1971 AND 1976, THERE HAS BEEN 

A STEADY OVERALL INCREASE IN ENROLMENTS TOTALLING ALMOST

12% AT NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS OVER THE , L..0 




THE SHIFT IN PREFERENCE TO NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS HAS BEEN

PARTICULARLY MARKED AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL, WHERE ENROLMENTS
                     ~, UE mac(.
AT GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS FELLJY gmE BETWEEN 1977 AND 1980,

IN CONTRAST TO glfet INCREASE IN NON-GOVERNMENT SECONDARY 

SCHOOL ENROLMENTS,




EVERYONE INTERESTED IN THE WELL-BEING OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS




       GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES, PARENTS, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS,




MUST BE,f-W CONCERNED AT THESE DECLINING ENROLMENTS AT 

GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS,




WHY HAVE THESE SHIFTS IN PREFERENCE TAKEN PLACE?



IN THE EARLY 1970s, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT BIG SPENDING ON 

EDUCATION WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF 

EDUCATION THAT PARENTS WANTED FOR THEIR CHILDREN,

            -5-

SOME SECTIONAL INTERESTS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT 
THE SHIFT IN ENROLMENTS AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS HAS BEEN 
CAUSED BY A SQUEEZE IN FUNDING FOR THOSE SCHOOLS AND
 INCREASING FUNDING FOR NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS.

 IT IS PLAINLY OBVIOUS THAT TM JUST ISN'T SO.

DESPITE INCREASING COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO NON-GOVERNMENT 
SCHOOLS, COMBINED STATE AND COMMONWEALTH GRANTS ARE STILL A LONG 
WAY BELOW EXPENDITURE LEVELS FOR GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS

   - TOTAL GRANTS FOR NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AMOUNT TO ONLY
     45% OF EXPENDITURE ON GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ON A PER 
     PUPIL BASIS,

   - AND EVEN WHEN SCHOOL FEES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, THE
     RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN MOST NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ARE 
     ABOUT 30% BELOW THOSE AVAILABLE IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS.

THE ARGUMENT SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS.

RATHER THE CONCERN SHOULD BE ABOUT PROVIDING THE RIGHT KIND OF 
EDUCATION TO MEET THE COMMUNITIES' REQUIREMENTS.

THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS PART, HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE 
ACTION IN THE FACE OF ITS CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF 
SCHOOL EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA - AND IT HAS FACED THAT 
RESPONSIBILITY.

                      -6-

FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMMONWEALTH HAS INTRODUCED THE SCHOOL-TO-WORK 
TRANSITION PROGRAMME WHICH IS PROVING PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL
IN HELPING THOSE I C LESS ACADEMICALLY INCLINED,

WE ARE PROVIDING $150 MILLION OVER A 5 YEAR PERIOD FOR 
TRANSITION ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOLS AND TECHNICAL AND FURTHER 
EDUCATION COLLEGES

        THESE GRANTS ARE BEING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

MORE GENERALLY, THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
THE COMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF A BALANCED EDUCATION SYSTEM

        ONE THAT CATERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE AIMING AT 
        TERTIARY EDUCATION BUT EQUALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE 
        LESS ACADEMICALLY INCLINED

        ONE THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF CHOICE 
        IN EDUCATION

        ONE THAT PROMOTES AN EFFECTIVE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH 
        MEETS THE EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE WHOLE 
        COMMUNITY.

THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO EDUCATION REFLECTS ITS BROADER 
PHILOSOPHY THAT AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE 
FREEDOM TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES THEIR OWN NEEDS, THEIR 
OWN WAY OF LIFE,

             -7-

GOVERNMENTS HAVE ACTED RESPONSIBLY IN PROVIDING THE RESOURCES 
TO ALLOW ALL SCHOOLS TO MOVE TO A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN 
PROVIDE THE KIND OF EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT THE COMMUNITY 
DESIRES.

I BELIEVE THAT ALL YOUNG AUSTRALIANS DESERVE AN EDUCATION 
SYSTEM THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO GIVE ITS STUDENTS THE 
SKILLS AND TRAINING APPROPRIATE TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL
ABILITIES AND AMBITIONS,

THE GREAT CHALLENGE FACING EDUCATORS IN THE 1980s IS TO 
ENSURE THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WORKS TO ENSURE THAT THIS 
IS ACHIEVED,
