                                                                                                                                                   COrstrUct_nf: .an interstate-

   road systea that will loOk after the needs of trade and defence and of

   iiriviate motorists with speed and safety.                  This .F-urely is       1:ation.al 

   task, one that .i.lust be undertaken by the ;'2:tates. and the Commonwea3_th,

              ton:ether -in harmony .to achieve real benefit for every 

   Australian.

                   Thirdly, °.vear'es: In this country we have a s:rstem of State

   arid Common.v4ealth           ad.uotmerits -.vhich axe made on application to a

   tribunal or a court.             I think everyone has some idea of the
   anomalies that have arisen, of the
if-Arbitration Court stopping quarterly- cost of living ad jtv,tments and 

   of those adjustzients colotinuinE in oiost States arld of the conseouent

   dissatisfaction tLat has resulted.                 ?he shearing cispute clearly 

   revealed the impossibility of maintaining arbiAration court decisions 

   unde trì :resent State-Comi_onwealth relationship on these ratters. 

   The State Fremiars and the Corc..roonwealth Government have just discussed 

   t pi 5 1, roblera in relation to our ;resent (ifficulties and it would

   have been a real tril.h if agreement had. been reached.                         I'll' devote
      future
   a             Q.e7,f.a to this difficalt oroblem..


                   There is another urgent problem that concerns only the 

   Con.monwealth, that is the relationship betwea-i the two FOU5r ti

   Senate and the heoresentatives.                 Under the old system ol voting 

   the party that got in front seemed to win nearly every seat now it is 

   very difficult for the Party with the numbers in the :1.-(epresentatives

   to have .the    numbers in the Senate-.            An -answer must be found to thLjr-.

   My -own view    is that the Senate should not be able to cause a double

   dissolution     but should iave a delaying power of about one year. 

                                                                       taxation, of roads,of these problems, of

   of wages and of the relationship betweeF the two Federal Houses not to 

   offer same fixed or dogmatic opinion on them but to shag if I can that

   our Constitutioo as drawn up in 1900 is by no means ideal for 1956.                              If 

   we want our Governments to do tie best possible job, if we went con-

   tinued social security and industrial peace, we roust have the courage 
   to tackle these problems and to realise that many of them have arisen
   because we are now irrevocably bound together as one Nation in a way
   that our Founding, Fathers never foresaw.                   This is not something we
   should try to hide.
