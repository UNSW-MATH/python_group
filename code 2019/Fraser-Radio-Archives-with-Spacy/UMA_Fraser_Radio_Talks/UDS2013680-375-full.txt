  this is in a way oore an argument :'car keeping India within the Cc onwoal~ 

    than it is an argumont for her withdrua al from. it.

 *hi  India has hd a varied history and only recently has she
received full demooratio self-government. Her peo e are d fferent 

from ours - in colour, language and religion. They belong to part 

of the great land mass of Asia, Millions of ior peoplGlive in eroat 

poverty which slowly and surely is being overcemee

      A.th this background it is nOt reasoneble t© 01,030'4 that 

India will think directly as we do on all international problema of 

 importance, and Ur. Macmillan, as tuo British krimo Minister aed leader 

 of the country which once governed India, has shown quite clearly that he 

 understands this. He haa said that although we ounnot always agree 

with the neutral view that India puts forward, her view is one which at 

 the very leaet we must respect. Thie is true and the people who cannot 

 see this are perhaps the renments of those who long for the days of the 

 British :empire and who cannot understand thnt the British :.,elpire has 

 changed into something much greater - the British Commezwealth.

      If we ere granted is leaderehip in Commonwealth opuntricie, 

 the Commonwealth (made more than anything els to help solve the 

 world's outstandine eroblem4.

      We have a free me, tine of Ielople who are comelutoly differew 

 in background and religion but who com togethix to discuss common 

 probleme freely and in friendshle. It moy be thnt no untt4 view 

 emerges from Commonwealth amtnxma conferences but the fact that the
      can come together to
 Commouwealth lenders/hear each others views and learn to reslest those

 views is important not only for the Comeonwealth but for the world

      How different it woule be if the United 1;ations were able 

 to conduct its Genf rencee on e world...wide basis in the swae fashion. 

 But this must be our hope ,and this is why the Commonwenith cal and 

 does pet a great example to tie; othel lictions of the world. Mr. 

 Macmillan has shown he realises this and as head of the first country 

 of the Commonweelth, thet is important.
