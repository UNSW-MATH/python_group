PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE 
   TALK











7 MARCH 1982

 AUSTRALIA HAS LONG BEEN CONCERNED AT THE ALMOST TOTAL 
 EXCLUSION OF OUR FARM PRODUCTS FROM EUROPEAN MARKETS
  - MARKETS WHICH WERE ONCE MAJOR ONES FOR OUR PRODUCE,

 WE ARE EQUALLY DISTURBED BY THE FACT THAT EUROPEAN 
 COUNTRIES HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPORTING INCREASING VOLUMES OF 
 HEAVILY SUBSIDISED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE TO THIRD MARKETS
  - IN MANY CASES MARKETS WHICH AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS
    HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO BUILD UP AFTER THEIR VIRTUAL 
    EXCLUSION FROM EUROPE,

OBVIOUSLY, THESE CONCERNS WERE AMONG THE ISSUES THAT WE 
DISCUSSED WITH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES (THE "E.C,")
 -  HIS EXCELLENCY, MR GASTON THORN,
 - DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO AUSTRALIA,

IT IS A MATTER OF REGRET TO AUSTRALIA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A 
CONTINUING DISPUTE WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY OVER TRADING
MATTERS
 - FOR IN MANY WAYS, IN MANY FIELDS, WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS
   THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND IMPORTANT,

OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT SURPRISING,

                  2.

AUSTRALIA AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE A SHARED HISTORY 
AND SHARED CULTURAL VALUES;
  - AND WE SHARE A COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AS 
    PARTNERS IN THE WESTERN ALLIANCE,

IN THE PAST YEAR,
  - A DELEGATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
    VISITED AUSTRALIA;
  - AUSTRALIA SIGNED AN IMPORTANT NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS 
    AGREEMENT WITH EURATOM (THE EX.'S ATOMIC ENERGY 
    COMMISSION);
  - AND AUSTRALIA AND THE E.C. HAVE HELD TALKS AT
    MINISTERIAL LEVEL TWICE, IN BRUSSELS LAST 
    DECEMBER, AND HERE IN CANBERRA LAST WEEK,

MOREOVER, ONE OF THE MAIN DUTIES WHICH PRESIDENT THORN 
PERFORMED DURING HIS VISIT WAS TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THE 
CANBERRA OFFICES OF THE E.C. COMMISSION'S DELEGATION TO 
AUSTRALIA,

AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF VERY FEW COUNTRIES OUTSIDE EUROPE WHERE 
THE E.C. COMMISSION HAS ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR RELATIONS WITH A SINGLE COUNTRY
 - AND ITS ESTABLISHMENT MUST SURELY CONTRIBUTE TO
   BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE CONSTRUCTIVE 
   RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE.

              3,

PRESIDENT THORN AND I SPOKE ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL 
SITUATION AS WELL AS ABOUT ECONOMIC MATTERS.
 - WE DISCUSSED AFGHANISTAN AND POLAND AND THE 
   IMPORTANT PROCESSES OF CONSULTATION AMONG THE 
   WESTERN ALLIES FOLLOWING THOSE EVENTS.
 - WE AGREED THAT IN THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL 
   SITUATION, THE UNITY OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE 
   IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER,
 - AND WE AGREED THAT THIS MEANS THAT SPECIAL 
   EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO AVOID DISPUTES 
   AMONG WESTERN COUNTRIES IN ALL FIELDS, AND 
   TO SOLVE THEM IF THEY ARISE.

TRADE DISPUTES, IN PARTICULAR, CAN PLACE ADDITIONAL AND 
UNNECESSARY STRAINS ON WESTERN UNITY.

IN THIS REGARD, THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT DISPUTE
       IN RELATION TO AUSTRALIA'S IMPORT POLICIES 
ON FOOTWEAR AND MOTOR VEHICLES.
 - THE E.C. HAS RAISED THE MATTER WITH THE G.M.T.
   IN GENEVA,

HOWEVER, DURING PRESIDENT THORN'S VISIT IT WAS AGREED THAT 
ANY ACTION ON THIS SHOULD BE DEFERRED PENDING FURTHER STUDY 
AND CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

             L4,

DESPITE OUR BROAD AGREEMENT ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES, 
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE E,C,'S POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAVE COST OUR FARMERS MANY HUNDREDS 
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN LOST EXPORT EARNINGS.
 - INDEED THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
   HAS ESTIMATED THAT IN RESPECT OF SUGAR ALONE, 
   THE TRADING POLICIES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 
   HAVE COST AUSTRALIA $130 MILLION ANNUALLY IN. 
   LOST EXPORT EARNINGS DURING THE PAST DECADE,

THESE LOSSES ARE A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE E,C,'S COMMON 
AGRICULTURAL POLICY WHICH PROVIDES ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION 
TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN EUROPE,

IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ASSISTANCE TO THOSE PRODUCERS 
FROM THE E.C., AND FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, AMOUNTS TO 
SOME $30 BILLION ANNUALLY,
 - AND IMPOSES A HUGE BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE IN
   THE FORM OF HIGHER TAXES, AND HIGHER FOOD PRICES,

THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY PURSUED BY THE E.C. INVOLVES 
SETTING VERY HIGH DOMESTIC PRICES FOR THE FULL RANGE OF 
TEMPERATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
 - AND APPLYING VARIABLE LEVIES WHICH EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT
   IMPORTS EXCEPT IN RARE CASES WHERE THERE ARE SHORTFALLS 
   IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION,

                5.
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THESE POLICIES HAVE LED TO SURPLUS 
PRODUCTION OF MANY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BY EUROPE'S 
FARMERS
 - WHICH ARE THEN EXPORTED, WITH THE FARMERS RECEIVING 
   FURTHER SUBSIDIES ON THESE SALES IN THE FORM OF 
   SO-CALLED EXPORT REFUNDS.

SO, NOT ONLY ARE OUR FARMERS' PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY 
EXCLUDED FROM EUROPEAN MARKETS
 - THEY ALSO FACE COMPETITION ON UNFAIR TERMS IN 
   OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD MARKET FROM EUROPEAN 
   FARMERS WHO ARE BEING SUBSIDISED FOR EXPORTING.

I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT PRESIDENT THORN ASSURED ME DURING 
OUR DISCUSSIONS OF HIS OWN PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO THE 
GOAL OF ENDING THE SUBSIDISATION OF EUROPEAN FARM EXPORTS 
TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
 - AND, GENERALLY, OF REFORMING THE COMMON 
   AGRICULTURAL POLICY TO PUT FIRM UPPER LIMITS 
   ON OVERALL EUROPEAN FARM PRODUCTION.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRESIDENT ALSO EMPHASISED THAT THE 
ECONOMIC SITUATION IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS RATHER BLEAK, 
WITH 10 MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS 
WILL RISE TO 11 OR EVEN 12 MILLIONS BY LATER IN THE YEAR
 - LEVELS WHICH COULD PLACE CONSIDERABLE STRAINS 
   ON POLITICAL STABILITY IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN 
   COUNTRIES,

                6,

 HE STRESSED THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MEAN THAT THERE ARE 
 LIMITED POSSIBILITIES AT PRESENT FOR THE TEN SOVEREIGN
 EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT EARLY 
 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN INDUSTRY OR AGRICULTURE,

 WE UNDERSTAND EUROPE'S PROBLEMS,

 WE ARE NOT ASKING THE E,C, TO FORCE FARMERS OUT OF FARMING,

 BUT WE DO ASK THAT POLICIES OF EXCESSIVE PROTECTION AND 
 ASSISTANCE BE REFORMED
  - AND THAT CHANGE IS NOT INDEFINITELY DEFERRED,

 MOST IMPORTANTLY WE ASK THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE 
 POLICIES ARE NOT EXPORTED OUTSIDE EUROPE
  - UNDERMINING THE RETURNS TO EFFICIENT AGRICULTURAL
    EXPORTERS IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD,

I AM PLEASED THAT THE E.C. COMMISSION NOW HAS AT ITS HELM 
A MAN COMMITTED TO WORK TOWARDS REFORMS IN THESE AREAS,


              oo000oo
