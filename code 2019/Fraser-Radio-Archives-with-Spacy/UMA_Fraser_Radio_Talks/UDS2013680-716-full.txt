ELECTORATE TALK SUNDAY 4 OCTOBER 1981


DURING THEIR DELIBERATION OVER THE RETREAT, THE HEADS OF
GOVERNMENT HAVE DECIDED TO ISSUE A DECLARATION OF THEIR BELIEF THAT

     IT IS IMPERATIVE TO REINVIGORATE THE DIALOGUE 
     BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS 
     A MATTER OF URGENCY,

     AND OF THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
     THAT PROCESS.

THEY HAVE AGREED ON A DECLARATION. IT HAS ONE OVER-RIDING 
PURPOSE:

     TO EXPRESS AS CLEARLY AND FORCEFULLY AS POSSIBLE, 
     THE CONCERN AND COMMITMENT OF THE LEADERS ON 
     THESE ISSUES,

EVERYTHING WHICH MIGHT DETRACT FROM THE CLARITY OF THIS 
IESSAGE HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY OMITTED,

THE DECLARATION DOESNOT DEAL WITH SPECIFICS OR WITH PRACTICAL 
MEASURES. THAT IT NOT ITS PURPOSE.

THESE, THE ISSUES OF TRADE, FOOD, ENERGY OR FINANCE, WILL BE 
DEALT WITH AT LENGTH IN THE COMMUNIQUE AT THE END OF THE MEETING.

BUT BECAUSE OF THE INTRINSIC IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY OF THE ISSUES

      AND BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE MELBOURNE CONFERENCE 
      IN RELATION TO THE NORTH-SOUTH SUMMIT IN MEXICO,

      THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT THINK IT ESSENTIAL TO 
      EXPRESS NOW, AND IN UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS

      THE IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACH TO THE MOBILISATION OF 
      THE WILL TO MAKE PROGRESS,

IT IS POSSIBLE TO OVER-EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF WILL AND 
COMMITMENT, BUT IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE - INDEED VERY EASY - 
TO UNDERESTIMATE THEM, THEY ARE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS 
FOR SUCCESS,

IT IS JUST AS MUCH A MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL FAILURE TO 
SURRENDER TO CURRENT REALITIES IN THESE ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL SPHERES, AS IT IS TO TRY TO APPEASE AGGRESSORS 
AND TYRANTS IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE.

WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT GROSS POVERTY AND INEQUALITY AS 
INEVITABLE, UNTIL WE HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY POSSIBILITY TO 
ELIMINATE THEM,

   -  AND DONE SO WITH VISION AND THE UTMOST DETERMINATION

   -  AND WITHOUT INHIBITION,

                         ,„/3

              -3

THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THIS DECLARATION.

IT COMES FROM THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT OF 41 COUNTRIES, 
REPRESENTING A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION.

IT IS A MESSAGE TO ALL THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD,

     INCLUDING ESPECIALLY THE NON-COMMONWEALTH
     GOVERNMENTS WHO WILL BE ATTENDING THE MEXICO SUMMIT,

WE SHALL BE DOING ALL WE CAN - INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY - 
TO ENSURE THAT THE MESSAGE REGISTERS,

     AND WE HOPE IT WILL SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE AND 
     ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

IT IS ALSO A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, RICH AND 
POOR:

     TO THE RICH, THAT THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST 
     REQUIRES ACTION;

     TO THE POOR, THAT THE COMMONWEALTH CARES FOR 
     THEIR PLIGHT AND IS DETERMINED TO MUSTER ITS 
     WEIGHT TO IMPROVE THEIR LOT.

THE LANGUAGE OF THIS DECLARATION IS NOT THE LANGUAGE OF 
COMPROMISE OR OFFICIAL CAUTION.

            -4


IT IS A POWERFUL COHERENT STATEMENT IN LANGUAGE INTENDED
TO APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION, WILL AND HUMANITY OF LEADERS 
AND PEOPLES,

I COMMEND IT TO YOUR ATTENTION,
