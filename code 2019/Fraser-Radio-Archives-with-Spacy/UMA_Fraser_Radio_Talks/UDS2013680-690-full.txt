 THE HON. MEMBER FOR WANNON - MALCOLM FRASER


 THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED BY ITS OWN SUPPORTERS TO SOMERSAULT 
 THIS WEEK, ON ONE OF ITS MAJOR BLUNDERS.


 THE LABOR CAUCUS OVERTURNED A CABINET DECISION TO REDUCE THE 
 SUPPORT PRICE FOR WOOL WHICH THE WOOL MARKETING CORPORATION 
 OPERATES. THE CABINET_ HAD WANTED TO LOWER THE SUPPORT PRICE 
 FROM 250¢ A KILO TO 200¢ A KILO FROM 1 JULY, IN 'A MOVE WHICH 
 WOULD HAVE HAD DISASTROUS EFFECTS ON THE WHOLE TRADE.


 THE.WOOL MARKETING CORPORATION USES ITS OWN FUNDS, PLUS'THE 
 PROCEEDS OF A LEVY ON GROWERS, TO FINANCE ITS MARKET 'OPERATIONS, 
 BACKED UP BY LOANS FROM THE TRADING BANKS AND THE GOVERNMENT, 
AT COMMERCIAL RATES OF INTEREST AND ON THE SECURITY OF THE CLIP.

THE PRICE SUPPORT SCHEME ACHIEVED STABILITY AND ORDERLY 
MARKETING FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL, WITHOUT RISKING TAXPAYERS'' 
MONEY, YET THE FEDERAL CABINET WANTED TO OVERTHROW. THIS.


JUST HOW DISASTROUS THE DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN WAS SHOWN BY 
THE CHAOS WHICH RESULTED WHEN THE DECISION BECAME KNOWN, WITH 
FUTURES TRADING BEING SUSPENDED, AND WOOL SALES CANCELLED. 
IF THE LABOR BACKBENCHERS HAD NOT REVOLTED AGAINST THE CABINET'S 
FOOLISH AND IRRESPONSIBLE DECISION, THE VALUE OF WOOL STOCKS NOW 
HELD BY THE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY $80 .MILLION' 
AND THE PRICE OF WOOL AT FUTURE SALES WOULD HAVE COME DOWN-BY
50¢.


THE INÇIDENT WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH THE 
'GOVERNMENT IS UNDERGOING, IN HOLDING ITS RANKS, IN LINE.

THE OPPOSITION TOOK TWO DECISIONS ON PRINCIPLE DURING THE 
WEEK ON IMPORTANT ISSUES. IT REJECTED BACK-DOOR APPROACHES 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED BLANK CHEQUE 
INSURANCE AGAINST CRITICISM OVER A RESCUE OPERATION FOR THE 
GREENVALE NICKEL PROJECT IN QUEENSLAND. 
GREENVALE
THE TRE9.SURER AND THE'ACTING TREASURER WERE BOTH TOLD THAT THE 
OPPOSITION WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE SECRET MANOEUVRING, AND 
THAT IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT 'TO DRAW UP 
PROPER PROPOSALS, WHICH COULD BE ANNOUNCED AND DISCUSSED IN 
PARLIAMENT.

GREENVALE TURNED TO THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF'THE GOVERNMENT'S REVALUATIONS, 
AND BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED OIL.

HOWEVER ITS DIFFICULTIES WERE AGGRAVATED. BY.INFLATION AND BY 
INDUSTRIAL UNREST WHICH CAUSED ENORMOUS PRODUCTION LOSSES.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT FORWARD NO PROPOSALS TO HELP THE COMPANY 
OUT OF THESE PROBLEMS, ALTHOUGH IT DID SEEK TO' INVOLVE THE 
OPPOSITION IN CONSULTATIONS OVER THE MATTER. HOWEVER IT IS 
NOT THE JOB OF THE OPPOSITION TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT MAKE UP 
ITS MIND,H AND THE APPROACHES WERE REJECTED.

IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB:TO PROPOSE AND THE OPPOSITION'S JOB 
TO EXA.MINE PROPOSALS.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL, ACT 
 PROMPTLY' ON THE BASIS OF AN IMPARTIAL REPORT SETTING OUT FULL. 
DETAILS OF THE. TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE INOVLVED IN 
ANY LOAN FOR THE GREENVALE PROJECT.

 BUT AS MATTERS NOW STAND, THE PROJECT TS LIKELY TO BECOME YET 
 ANOTHER CASUALTY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC FAILURE.

SUPERANNUATION
THE OPPOSITION IS SUPPORTING MANY FEATURES OF THE GOVERNMENT 
BILLS NOW BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT WHICH SET UP A NEW SUPERANNUATION 
SCHEME FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS.

CONTRIBUTORS UNDER THE PAST SCHEME HAVE HAD TO PAY IN TOO MUCH 
DURING THEIR FINAL YEARS OF SERVICE. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO CONVERT PART OF THEIR PENSION TO A LUMP SUM, WHILE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FAR TOO COSTLY.

HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT NOW'PROPOSES TO GIVE PUBLIC SERVANTS THE 
OPTION OF RETIRING ON FULL PENSION AT THE AGE OF 60 YEARS, 
INSTEAD OF 65, FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SENSIBLE ARGUMENT.

IT ALSO PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL PENSION FOR PERSONS WHO HAVE 
SERVED MORE THAN 30 YEARS WHEN THEY RETIRE, WHICH AGAIN THE 
OPPOSITION CONSIDERS TO BE EXCESSIVE.

THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RAISE THE WIDOW'S PENSION FROM 62 PERCENT 
TO 67 PERCENT OF THE MEMBER'S PENSION. THE OPPOSITION OPPOSES 
THIS, BUT IT BELIEVES THE PROVISION FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN
SHOULD BE IMPROVED.

THE OPPOSITION ALSO BELIEVES THE BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED SO THAT 
IT IS ONLY THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS LINTKED TO THE 
CONSUMER.PRICE INDEX. PRIVATE INDUSTRY JUST COULD NOT AFFORD 
TO GUARANTEE INDEXATION FOR THEIR PENSIONERS.

THE OPPOSITION IS AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY.EXPEDIENT 
TO SUPPORT THE BILLS AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT THEM FORWARD. 
HOWEVER, IT HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT, ON 
THIS OR ANY OTHER ISSUE.

AS IMPORTANT AS THE PUBLIC SERVICE IS, THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY 
ON A MAJOR' POLITICAL PARTY Tb ACCEPT A TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ALL AUSTRALIANS, AND FOR THE TAXES THAT THEY PA's' INTO THE 
NATIONAL REVENUES.

THESE FUNDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ESTABLISH ,A SUPERANNUATION 
SCHEME WHICH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY CANNOT HOPE TO ENJOY.
