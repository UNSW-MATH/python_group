PRIME MINISTER'S
ELECTORATE TALK
SUNDAY, 14 MARCH 1982

A FEW DAYS AGO, IN A SPEECH TO THE PARLIAMENT AND TO THE 
NATION, I DREW ATTENTION TO THE INCREASINGLY TROUBLED AND 
UNCERTAIN WORLD SCENE;

    TO THE TENSIONS AND THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
    THAT EXIST;

    AND TO THE PROLONGED RECESSION IN EUROPE AND NORTH 
    AMERICA WHICH HAS REDUCED WORLD TRADE AND WORLD GROWTH 
    TO A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL.

WE IN AUSTRALIA CANNOT IGNORE THOSE DEVELOPMENTS.

  - WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT IS INCREASINGLY INTERDEPENDENT,

  - AND WE ARE INEVITABLY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND 
    ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES OVERSEAS.

BUT, WHILE THERE IS NO DENYING THAT WE CANNOT TURN OUR BACKS 
ON DEVELOPMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD,

    WHILE THERE IS NO DENYING THAT THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 
    IMPACT ON US,

  - OUR INTERDEPENDENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES 
    NOT MAKE US TOTALLY CAPTIVE TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS.

INTERDEPENDENCE DOES NOT IMPLY A COMPLETE LOSS OF OUR 
INDEPENDENCE.

            2.

   RATHER IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO BE 
   FACED;

 - IT MEANS THAT THE POLICIES OF GOVERNMENTS, AND THE
   ATTITUDES AND EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE MUST BE SHAPED 
   TO FACE REALISTICALLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TIME.

FOR MOST OF THE POST-WAR PERIOD, OUR INCREASING LINKS WITH 
THE WORLD ECONOMY AND WORLD FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN 
POSITIVELY BENEFICIAL.

ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, AUSTRALIA BENEFITTED 
GREATLY FROM THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF WORLD TRADE AND 
INVESTMENT THAT OCCURRED IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE WAR 
UNTIL THE EARLY 1970's.
INDEED BECAUSE OF OUR SMALL DOMESTIC MARKET, AND OUR 
RELATIVELY SMALL DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT, 
OUR ABILITY TO TAP OVERSEAS MARKETS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT 
TO THE GROWTH OF OUR REAL INCOMES.

   WE LOOK TO OTHERS TO PROVIDE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, 
   AND TO ENABLE OUR INDUSTRIES TO ACHIEVE THE SCALE OF 
   OPERATIONS THAT ENABLE THEM TO BE INTERNATIONALLY 
   COMPETITIVE;

 - 


            3.

 - WE LOOK TO OTHERS TO PROVIDE THE SPECIALISED IMPORTS 
   WE NEED FOR INDUSTRIAL AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT;

   AND OUR REAL LIVING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY
   THE WILLINGNESS OF OTHERS TO INVEST IN AUSTRALIA'S 
   INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCE PROJECTS IN CO-OPERATION WITH 
   AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL AND AUSTRALIAN MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRST OF THE DRAMATIC OIL PRICE INCREASES IN 1973 MARKED 
THE END OF OUR ERA OF RAPID WORLD GROWTH
 - ALTHOUGH THE DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC STABILITY AND
   THE ASSOCIATED ACCELERATION IN WORLD INFLATION WERE 
   CLEARLY APPARENT BEFORE THOSE PRICE RISES OCCURRED

 - AND CAN BE ATTRIBUTED IN LARGE PART TO EXCESSIVE 
   GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND INAPPROPRIATE 
   DEFICIT FINANCING POLICIES PURSUED BY MANY COUNTRIES.

IN AUSTRALIA, THE BIG SPENDING, BIG DEFICIT POLICIES OF THE 
LABOR GOVERNMENT EXACERBATED PROBLEMS THAT WERE ALREADY 
EVIDENT.

WHEN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE IN 1975 WE PUT INTO 
PLACE POLICIES DESIGNED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE, GROWTH AND 
PROSPERITY TO AUSTRALIA AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AN ALREADY 
WEAK WORLD ECONOMIC SCENE.

            4.

WE MADE THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR 
POLICIES
 - AND THROUGH RESTRAINT OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING,
   WINDING BACK THE BUDGET DEFICIT, AND CONTROL OF 
   THE MONEY SUPPLY,

 - THROUGH THE PROVISION OF INCENTIVES TO INDUSTRY TO
   INVEST, TO UNDERTAKE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND 
   SEEK OUR NEW AND EXPANDED EXPORT MARKETS,

 - WE SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING CONFIDENCE TO THE PRIVATE
   SECTOR, AND WE GAVE IT THE ROOM IT NEEDED TO ONCE 
   AGAIN BECOME THE MAINSPRING OF GROWTH AND 
   DEVELOPMENT.

MOREOVER, THROUGH OUR DECISIVE ACTION IN INTRODUCING IMPORT 
PARITY PRICING FOR OIL, AND ASSOCIATED POLICIES FOR OLD AND 
NEW OIL

   WE SUCCEEDED IN REVITALISING THE PETROLEUM EXPLORATION 
   AND DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY,

 - PROVIDING AUSTRALIA WITH RENEWED ACTIVITY AND RENEWED
   SECURITY OF SUPPLY.

              5.
THAT OUR POLICIES WERE RIGHT,

  - THAT THE RIGHT POLICIES AND ATTITUDES CAN ENABLE US 
    TO SUCCEED AGAINST WORLD TRENDS,

  - IS CONVINCINGLY DEMONSTRATED BY AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC 
    PERFORMANCE IN RECENT YEARS.

FOR WE HAVE HAD

  - ECONOMIC GROWTH AT TWICE THE AVERAGE OF OTHER MAJOR
    INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES IN RECENT YEARS,

  - THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCREASE IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT
    FOR THREE DECADES LAST FINANCIAL YEAR,

  - AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT AND IN AFTER-TAX
    REAL INCOMES OVER SEVERAL YEARS,

  - WHILE MOST OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES IN
    EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO 
    MAINTAIN ANY GROWTH AT ALL.
INDEED, FOLLOWING FURTHER SUBSTANTIAL OIL PRICE INCREASES IN 
1978-79, THEIR GROWTH RATES DECLINED EVEN MORE AS THEY ENTERED 
THE 1980's,

                         6.

   -  THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE HIGH AND RISING,

      AND BECAUSE OF HIGH BUDGET DEFICITS AND THE ASSOCIATED 
      NEED FOR STRINGENT MONETARY POLICIES IN SOME COUNTRIES,
      INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN TO SOME OF THE HIGHEST
      LEVELS THE WORLD HAS SEEN.

AT THE SAME TIME, DEPRESSED DEMAND AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS 
LED THEIR INFLATION RATES TO FALL.

THROUGH TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS WE HAVE NOW 
BEGUN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THESE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

      AT A TIME WHEN WAGE DEMANDS IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN 
      GROWING.

THE CURRENT SITUATION MAKES IT ALL THE MI).T ESSENTIAL THAT 
THE BROAD THRUST OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES BE MAINTAINED.
WITH A WEAKENED BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND „A   INFLATIONARY
PRESSURES

      THERE CAN BE NO THOUGHT OF ALLOWING THE MONEY SUPPLY 
      TO EXPAND TO ACCOMMODATE INFLATIONARY WAGE DEMANDS,

      AND NO THOUGHT OF ABANDONING OUR CAREFUL AND NON- 
       DISRUPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE.

              7.

WITH WAGE PRESSURES AND INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION ALREADY 
AFFECTING EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS,

    OUR INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND 
    BRING ABOUT A RESTRUCTURING OF UNIONS ARE ALL THE 
    MORE ESSENTIAL.

AND WITH THE NEED TO SEEK LOWER TAXATION AND A MORE BALANCED 
TAX STRUCTURE, WHILE MAKING PROVISION FOR THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS 
OF DEFENCE, THE ELDERLY AND THE DISADVANTAGED

  - THERE CAN BE NO THOUGHT OF ABANDONING OUR POLICIES OF 
    RESTRAINING GOVERNMENT SPENDING.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS FOR 
THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN ARE PLAIN.
  - WE SEEK RISING STAND RDS O LIVING

  - AND AN INCREASINGLY COMPASSIONATE AND SECURE SOCIETY,
    BUT ONE IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE FREE TO DEVELOP THEIR 
    TALENTS AND EXPRESS THEIR INDIVIDUALITY IN THEIR OWN 
    WAY.

IN DIFFICULT TIMES SUCH AS THOSE WE EXPERIENCE AT PRESENT WE 
MUST ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE TIGHTER LIMITS ON THE RATE AT 
WHICH OUR ASPIRATIONS CAN BE FULFILLED.

          8.


ABOVE ALL WE CANNOT, AS A NATION, AFFORD TO DESTROY THE 
CONDITIONS WHICH FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH,

   FOR IT IS ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE 
   FOR US TO SATISFY OUR BROADER GOAL OF DEVELOPING 
   FURTHER A STRONG, CIVILISED AND HUMANE SOCIETY.
