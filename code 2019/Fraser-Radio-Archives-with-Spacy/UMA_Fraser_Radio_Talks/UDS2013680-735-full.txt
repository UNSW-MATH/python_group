PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK
SUNDAY, 9 MAY 1982

NEXT SATURDAY, I LEAVE AUSTRALIA FOR A SHORT BUT MOST 
IMPORTANT OVERSEAS VISIT.

I Av AFRAID IT WON'T BE VERY RELAXING; CROWDED INTO ABOUT
10 DAYS WILL BE VISITS TO THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND KOREA.

WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MR BUSH, WAS 
IN AUSTRALIA A WEEK AGO, WE DISCUSSED MY FORTHCOMING MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN IN WASHINGTON,

IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE 
UNITED STATES LEADER, BUT IT IS PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE AT 
THIS TIME.

NO DOUBT WE SHALL DISCUSS THE FALKLAND ISLANDS CRISIS

    NOT ONLY AS A REGRETTABLE CLASH BETWEEN THE 
    UNITED KINGDOV AND INVADING ARGENTINA

    NOR INDEED ONLY FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 
    RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE

    BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT COULD AFFECT SOUTH AMERICAN 
    CONFIDENCE IN THE WEST AND THE NATO ALLIANCE 
    AND THEREBY SET BACK UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO 
    KEEP THE WHOLE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT FIRMLY 
    IN THE WESTERN CAMP.

             2.
HOWEVER, THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WILL NOT BE CENTRAL TO OUR 
DISCUSSIONS WHICH WILL BE CONDUCTED AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF 
SEVERE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN THE WEST AND AGGRESSIVE SOVIET 
POLICIES AROUND THE WORLD.
I SHALL BE TALKING TO PRESIDENT REAGAN LARGELY ABOUT TWO 
SUMMIT MEETINGS DUE TO TAKE PLACE IN EUROPE NEXT MONTH.

ONE IS ECONOMIC AND THE OTHER STRATEGIC.

BOTH SUMMITS ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE VERY SECURITY 
AND WELL-BEING OF WESTERN NATIONS.

THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WILLBE HELD AT VERSAILLES

    THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT OF THE MAJOR ECONOMIC 
    POWERS - THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, 
    FRANCE, WEST GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN AND
    CANADA - WILL ATTEND, AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT 
    OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES.

IT IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD 
EVERY YEAR SINCE 1975 TO CONSIDER THE MAJOR ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE WEST.

INDEED THE CONCERNS OF THE LEADERS EXTEND TO THE ECONOMIC 
RELATIONS BETWEEN WESTERN COUNTRIES AND THE SOVIET BLOC

             3,

    BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

    AND BETWEEN ENERGY SUPPLYING COUNTRIES AND 
    THE CONSUMERS,

THEREFORE, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN A REGULAR MEETING
OF THE HEADS OF SEVEN GOVERNMENTS TO DISCUSS MUTUAL ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS,

IT IS A GATHERING WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE ECONOMIC FUTURE 
OF MANY NATIONS INCLUDING OUR OWN,

WE CANNOT BE INSULATED FROM WORLD ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND OUR 
POSITION AS A SIGNIFICANT TRADING NATION ONLY INCREASES OUR 
INTERDEPENDENCE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,

ALTHOUGH AUSTRALIA IS NOT A MEMBER OF NATO, THE NORTH 
ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION, WE ARE VITALLY INTERESTED 
IN THE SECOND SUMMIT IN EUROPE

    WHICH IS A SPECIAL MEETING OF NATO TO BE
    ATTENDED BY THE SAME LEADERS ATTENDING THE 
    ECONOMIC SUMMIT, EXCEPT JAPAN

      TOGETHER WITH THE SMALLER WEST 
      EUROPEAN NATO MEMBERS.

 WHEREAS THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT IS NOW AN ANNUAL EVENT, THE NATO 
 MEETING IS A SPECIAL MEETING REFLECTING

     CONCERN OVER THE WORLD STRATEGIC SITUATION

   - AND THE NEED TO MAINTAIN NATO AS AN ANCHOR
     OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE.

 THE SOVIET UNION'S PROVOCATIVE POLICIES ARE CLEARLY 
 ILLUSTRATED IN THE OCCUPATION OF AFGHANISTAN, THE
 REGRESSION IN POLAND, SOVIET BACKING FOR THE CONTINUING 
 VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF KAMPUCHEA, AND THEIR DIRECT AND 
 INDIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN PARTS OF CENTRAL AMERICA, AFRICA AND 
 PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST,

 IT IS IRONIC THAT, IN FREE SOCIETIES, THE VERY EXERCISING OF 
 FREEDOM CAN LEAD TO CONCERN THAT THERE IS NOT A COMMON PURPOSE 
TO DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC WAY OF LIFE,

 IN AUSTRALIA, WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE NATO MEMBERS HAVE A 
UNITY OF PURPOSE

     AND ARE RESOLVED TO A UNITY OF ACTION,
AT NEXT MONTH'S MEETING, NATO'S LEADERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO GIVE THE FREE WORLD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN SHOWING THAT 
UNITY AND RESOLVE

             5.
I SHALL BE DISCUSSING THESE MATTERS WITH MR REAGAN AND, IN 
JAPAN, WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, MR SUZUKI BEFORE HE ATTENDS 
THE VERSAILLES SUMMIT,

OF COURSE, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN HAVE MUTUAL TRADING INTERESTS

    TOGETHER WITH CONCERNS FOR THE SECURITY OF THE EAST
    ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGIONS, AND MY TALKS WITH 
    MR SUZUKI WILL COVER THESE ISSUES,

WE THINK OF JAPAN VERY MUCH IN ECONOMIC TERMS,

HOWEVER, JAPAN IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE OVERALL WESTERN 
ALLIANCE,

IT IS NOT TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT JAPAN'S ATTITUDE AND DIRECTION 
WILL BEAR HEAVILY ON THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD,

I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO MY TALKS IN WASHINGTON AND TOKYO, 
AS WELL AS IN SEOUL, THE CAPITAL OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA,

THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA'S STABILITY AND SECURITY ARE IMPORTANT 
TO AUSTRALIA, BOTH STRATEGICALLY AND FROM A TRADING POINT 
OF VIEW,

OUR TWO-WAY TRADE WITH KOREA HAS GROWN TO ALMOST $1 BILLION 
A YEAR.

                 6,

AS A RELIABLE AND RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY OF 
WESTERN NATIONS

      AUSTRALIA IS MAINTAINING A STRONG, MODERN 
      DEFENCE FORCE DESIGNED TO MEET THE THREATS AND 
      CHALLENGES OF THE TIMES

      AND IS PURSUING CONSISTENT ECONOMIC POLICIES 
      TO COPE WITH THE PRESENT WORLD ECONOMIC 
      SITUATION AS IT AFFECTS AUSTRALIA.

WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN NEXT MONTH'S VITAL SUMMIT MEETINGS
AND IN MY FORTHCOMING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
AND JAPANESE LEADERS, WE SHALL CONTRIBUTE TO

      IT WILL BE MY PURPOSE TO GIVE PROMINENCE
      TO OUR CONCERNS AND PERSPECTIVES ON THE ISSUES 
      BEING CONSIDERED,

WE ARE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS IN STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC 
TERMS,

WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT WITH 
OUR LARGER FRIENDS AND ALLIES,

AND WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN NEXT MONTH'S VITAL SUMMIT 
MEETINGS,

THROUGH MY FORTHCOMING DISCUSSIONS, AUSTRALIA SHALL BE 
PARTICIPATING CONSTRUCTIVELY IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS TO 
THE MAJOR WORLD PROBLEMS OF OUR TIMES,
