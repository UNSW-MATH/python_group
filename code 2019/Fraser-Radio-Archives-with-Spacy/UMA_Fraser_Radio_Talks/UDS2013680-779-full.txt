    Leader of the Opposition


      ELECTORAL TALK           FOR 3HA 19TH OCTOBER
                               FOR 3YB 23RD OCTOBER

      THE PRIME MINISTERS FIRST REACTION TO THE DECISION WHICH 
      WE HAVE MADE, TO DEFER THE BUDGET UNTIL THERE ARE GENERAL 
~     ELECTIONS, IS DEPLORABLE AND DANGEROUS.
      HE HAS DECIDED TO FLOUT THE PARLIAMENT AND TO FLOUT THE 
      PEOPLE, HIS DECISION, DESCRIBED AS "TOUGHING IT OUT", CAN 
      ONLY MAKE WORSE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH THE POLICIES OF 
      HIS GOVERNMENT HAVE, OVER THREE YEARS, PRODUCED IN THIS 
      ONCE PROSPEROUS AND ONCE STABLE COUNTRY,

      THE DECISION WHICH THE OPPOSITION PARTIES TOOK THIS WEEK 
      WAS DIFFICULT, IT WAS FORCED ON US BY CIRCUMSTANCE. THE 
      LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE MOST INCOMPETENT AND DISASTROUS 
      IN THE HISTORY OF THE FEDERATION.

      ITS INCOMPETENCE_ HAS PRODUCED THE WORST UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE
      THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE MOST PROLONGED INFLATION IN OUR 
      HISTORY.

      IT HAS DESTROYED THE SAVINGS OF THE ELDERLY AND THE PROSPECTS 
      OF THE YOUNG, IT HAS WIPED OUT BUSINESSES, LARGE AND SMALL, 
      BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOR, FARMER AND CITY WORKER, ARE VICTIMS 
      TO THIS ADMINISTRATION.
    Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600 /2.

Leader of the Opposition
                            -2

    TO ITS BLUNDERING IT HAS ADDED DISGRACE, THROUGH A SERIES 
    OF SCANDALS WHICH RESULTED IN THE SACKING OR FORCED 
    RESIGNATIONS OF THE MOST SENIOR OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S MEN,

    THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUNK TO ITS PRESENT PARLOUS STATE THROUGH 
    WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION,                                          ~
    IT LACKS THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE 
    REASON ALONE, IT DID NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE THE 
    MEASURES THAT WERE NEEDED WHEN THE TIME TO TAKE THEM WAS 
    STILL THERE.

    FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO TALK NOW OF TOUGHING IT OUT IS 
    FARCICAL. IF HE HAD BEEN TOUGH - TOUGH ENOUGH TO COMMAND 
    HIS PARTY AND HIS CABINET, TOUGH ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HOUSE
    IN ORDER, TOUGH ENOUGH TO GET ON WITH THE JOB OF RUNNING          i 
    THIS COUNTRY, HIS STOCKS WOULD NOT BE SO ABYSMALLY LOW,

    NOW HE LACKS THE COURAGE TO FACE THE PEOPLE, HE LACKS THE 
    COURAGE TO FACE THE FACTS. HE LACKS THE INTEGRITY TO UPHOLD 
    THE CONSTIITUTION, WHICH IN A SITUATION OF DEADLOCK, PROVIDES 
    A SOLUTION,

    THAT SOLUTION IS A DOUBLE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT, FOLLOWED 
    BY GENERAL ELECTIONS,

Parli /En e1/1ATE      AFd.~~~~~ODER THE CONSTITUTION TO ACT IT IS

Leader of the Opposition
             3

 NO HEREDITARY HOUSE OF LORDS BUT A PEOPLES HOUSE 
 ELECTED OH FULL ADULT FRANCHISE,

 AND THE PEOPLE, WHO GAVE LABOR THEIR CHANCE TO GOVERN, GAVE
 THE OPPOSITION PARTIES THE NUMBERS IN THE SENATE TO IMPOSE 
 A SANCTION FOR FAILURE,

 THE TIME TO IMPOSE THAT SANCTION HAS ARRIVED,
 FOR THE SAKE OF THE POLITICAL HEALTH OF THIS NATION, FOR THE
 SAKE EVEN OF THE LABOR PARTY ITSELF, IT IS TO BE HOPED 
 THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL FIND THE COURAGE TO TOUGH 
 IT OUT ON THE HUSTINGS,

 IT IS TIME TO LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE,
