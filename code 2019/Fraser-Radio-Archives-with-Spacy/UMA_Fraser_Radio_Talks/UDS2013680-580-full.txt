                      On the subject of wheat sales it is pleasing 
                  indeed to note that the wheat growing areas of 
                  Western Victoria are experiencing one of their 
                  best seasons for many years. The rain over the 
                  wimmera in the past few days will give our crops 
                  a welcome boost. Our hope is that the present 
                  encouraging situation continues.


                     The wheat quota for Victoria this season is 
                  57 million bushells, up five million bushells 
                  from last year. And the latest rough estimate by 
                  members of the Australian Wheat Board indicate that 
                  the total yield from the 2- million acres sown to 
                  wheat in Victoria will be approximately 60 million 
                  bushells.


                      This is quite a jump from the total crop last 
                  year of 32 million bushells, but with the low 
                  carryover at the present time still puts the wheat 
                  industry in a very sound position. At a time when

         relief agencies by a further 2 and a half million 
         dollars, bringing our total contribution so far to 
         five-and-a-half million dollars.
           We will continue to constantly review and assess 
         the aid situation in collaboration with the authorities 
•        concerned.
           i I would like to add that the Governments record 
         in the provision of aid has been vim- effective. We 
         have sought to control supply of food and equipment 
         in such a way that it has reached the areas promptly 
         in in a form which matched the immediate needs of the 
         refugees.
          Thank you and goodbye for now.
