PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK
SUNDAY, 28 MARCH 1982

DURING THE COMING WEEK THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA WILL BE MAKING
                            rNi
THEIR REAL DECISION ABOUT HOW - _:; STATE WILL BE GOVERNED 

OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS


   -  AND NOBODY SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF

      CHOOSING RIGHTLY


   -  BECAUSE THE COSTS AND DAMAGE OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT IN

      VICTORIA WOULD BE ENORMOUS,



AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPAIGN, THE MEASURE OF THE PARTIES AND

THEIR LEADERS, AND THE REAL ISSUES THIS ELECTION, ARE NOW 

STARKER AND PLAINER THAN EVER.



IT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION OF THE KIND* OF PEOPLE WE WANT TO 

GOVERN VICTORIA


   -  AND THE POLICIES AND GOALS WE WANT TO PURSUE,



ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS LINDSAY THOMPSON, INDEPENDENT AND 

FREE TO GOVERN IN THE INTEREST OF ALL


   -  WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF DEDICATION AND EFFICIENCY


   -  WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES WANT


   -  AND WITH POLICIES TO KEEP BUILDING VICTORIA UP DURING THE '80s,

                       2






 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS THE CAIN LABOR PARTY
     TOTALLY j R. 2 E S Po/ S 18 L E A8,00- T HEr 2 pi~Orí l/ 7
   - WITH THE SOCIALIST LEFT WAITING IN THE WINGS, READY TO 

     CALL IN ITS DEBTS


   - AND WITH THE MILITANT UNIONS POISED TO WORT SWEETHEART 
       TN T 0/L1-,
     DEALS, DAMAGE EMPLOYMENT, LIVING STANDARDS AND GROWTH 

     IN VICTORIA,



VICTORIA IS A GREAT STATE


   - WITH THE HIGHEST. HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN AUSTRALIA


   - THE HIGHEST HOME OWNERSHIP IN AUSTRALIA


   - WITH TREMENDOUS RURAL ovTPv r, LONG ESTABLISHED RESOURCE 

     PROJECTS THROUGH COAL AND OIL, AND GREAT MANUFACTURING 

     ENTERPRISES,


            J71EN 1(/4TES
LABOR                 THESE AND OTHER GREAT LIBERAL 

ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH HAVE MADE VICTORIA A STATE THAT WE CAN ALL 

BE PROUD OF,



   INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING WORKABLE, REALISTIC POLICIES TO KEEP 

BUILDING VICTORIA UP


   - LABOR HAS GONE AROUND MAKING PROMISE UPON PROMISE FOR

     GOVERNMENT SPENDING SCHEMES

             3


 - PROMISES WHICH LINDSAY THOMPSON HAS ADDED UP TO A COST
   OF MORE THAN $3,000 MILLION THREE YEARS ALONE - $21 PER 
   WEEK FOR EVERY FAVILY.

AND WHEN LABOR WERE TOLD WHAT IT WOULD ALL COST,
 - THEY TRIED TO DENY THE COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE, EVEN 
   THOUGH THEY ARE WRITTEN DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE,

THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS,

NOR WILL THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE STAND FOR THE SIX HUNDRED 4D.D 
MILLION DOLLAR SO-CALLED DEVELOPMENT FUND
 - LABOR'S RABBIT OUT OF A HAT
 - WHICH WOULD MILK THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES OF THEIR FUNDS
 - AND WHICH THE OFFICIAL, EXPERT COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY 
   HAS REJECTED,

I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA WILL RUN THE CERTAIN 
RISK OF THE KIND OF CHAOS THAT NOW PLAGUES THE WRAN GOVERNMENT 
IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AS IT PLAGUED THE LAST DAYS OF THE HOLGATE 
GOVERNMENT IN TASMANIA.

                  4

 IN EVERY CASE, LABOR'S MISMANAGEMENT IN OFFICE
  - THEIR INABILITY TO GOVERN WELL
  - NEVER FAILS TO BE REVEALED,
 VICTORIA DOES NOT WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT RELIES ON IMPRACTICAL 
 GIMMICKS,

 WE DO NOT WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT 
 THE UNION BOSSES WANT,

 WE DO NOT WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT CANNOT FACE UP TO THE REAL 
 ISSUES
  - THAT TRIES TO HIDE ITS REAL INTENTIONS WHEN THE DAMAGING 
    COSTS OF ITS PROVISES ARE BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN,
WE WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT KNOWS WHERE IT IS GOING
  - WHOSE GOALS MATCH THE NEEDS AND WANTS OF VICTORIANS 
    AND THEIR FAMILIES
  - WHICH CAN IMPLEMENT PRACTICAL POLICIES IN THE INTERESTS 
    OF ALL VICTORIANS,

THAT MEANS A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT FOR VICTORIA
  - AND LINDSAY THOMPSON FOR PREMIER,
