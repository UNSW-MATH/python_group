ELECTORAL PRESS STATEMENT         13th February, 1975.
            THE HON. MEMBER FOR WANNON - MALCOLM FRASER
The proposed division of Wannon into its new electoral boundaries will 
make it one of the biggest electorates both in population and size in 
the state.
There are a number of criticisms that must be made on the proposed dis- 
tribution. The sub-division of Allansford with its close commmunity 
of interest with Warnambool is moved into Corangamite. Allansford 
does not look to Geelong, it looks to Warrnambool and should remain 
in the same electorate as Warrnambool itself. In addition the sub- 
divisions of Ararat and Stawell are added to Wannon.

These have their own communities of interest but are largely divided 
from the heart of Wannon by the Grampions. Horsham is excluded from 
the proposed Wannon division even though sub-divisions to the east 
and to the west both extend north of the city.
What is proposed for Wannon is consistent with the Government's objec- 
tive of reducing rural representation and adding additional seats to the 
major capital cities.
There will be more seats in the cities - there will be less rural re- 
presentation. Many members cross the Gloss-knit city seats in twenty 
minutes. A large rural seat such as Wannon involves many hours of
travel. In my case 30,000 to 40,000 miles a year. The present el- 
ectoral law is,in my view,a bad law and as a result it is a bad re- 
distribution.
