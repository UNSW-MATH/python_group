PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK
SUNDAY, 6 JUNE 1982

  - 



TAX AVOIDANCE IS AN ACTIVITY

  - THAT COSTS EVERY DECENT MEMBER OF THE 
    AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY DEARLY•

AVOIDANCE IS, TO BE SURE, A VERY SLIPPERY CONCEPT•

BUT BASICALLY, IT AMOUNTS TO ARRANGING ONE'S AFFAIRS 
WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF MINIMISING TAX

    STRICTLY OBEYING THE NARROW TERMS OF TAX
    LEGISLATION

  - BUT NOT ITS SPIRIT AND INTENT

  - AND ULTIMATELY IT INVOLVES SHIFTING THE BURDEN 
    OF TAXATION ON TO THE HONEST TAXPAYER•

ANYONE WHO PAYS LESS THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAX DOES 
SO AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNITY•

  - FOR EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED 
    SERVICES, AND FROM THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW

  - AND THOSE WHO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF 
    THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES ARE BLUDGING ON

            2

    THOSE WHO DO•

BUT THE FINANCIAL COST OF AVOIDANCE IS NOT MEASURED 
SIMPLY BY THE EXTRA TAX THE REST OF US HAVE TO PAY•

  - TAX REVENUE HAS TO BE DEVOTED TO DEVISING, 
    IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING ANTI-AVOIDANCE 
    LAWS

  - AND TO PROSECUTING THOSE CAUGHT CHEATING•

THE COST ALSO INCLUDES THE RESOURCES, THE TIME AND THE 
EFFORT NOT ONLY OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO AVOID TAXATION

  - BUT ALSO OF THEIR ADVISERS - THEIR HIGH-PRICED
    ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS

  - WHO MAKE A RICH LIVING OFF WHAT THEY EARN BY 
    PROMOTING SCHEME AFTER SCHEME TO RIP OFF THE 
    REST OF THE COMMUNITY•

TAX AVOIDANCE NOT ONLY INVOLVES FINANCIAL COSTS : IT IS 
ANTI-SOCIAL, AND UN-AUSTRALIAN•

  - IT IS BEHAVIOUR THAT UNDERMINES THE SOCIAL 
    FABRIC;

•                 3.

        - IT DOES SO AS SURELY - OR MORE SO - AS THE
          IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR OF THAT MINORITY OF 
          MILITANT UNIONISTS WHO THINK AND ACT AS IF 
          THEY CAN WITH IMPUNITY TRAMPLE ON THE RIGHTS 
          OF THE COMMUNITY OF WHICH THEY ARE PART;

        - AND THE PERSON WHO INDULGES IN AVOIDANCE BY
          FINDING AN ARTIFICIAL LOOPHOLE TO SLIP OUT OF 
          TAX IS, IN OUR VIEW, AS GUILTY OF A CRIME 
          AGAINST SOCIETY AS THE PERSON WHO EVADES TAX 
          BY FALSELY DECLARING HIS INCOME.

     No GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE TO FIGHT TAX AVOIDANCE THAN 
     THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT

        - AND TREASURER JOHN HOWARD HAS ATTACKED TAX
          AVOIDANCE MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN ANY OTHER 
          TREASURER IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY

          IT IS INDEED BECAUSE OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S 
          ACTIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TAX AVOIDANCE AND THE 
          PUBLICITY WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN TO THIS
          ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR

        - THAT THE AVERAGE AUSTRALIAN HAS BECOME SO
          AWARE OF IT.
     UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ACTED ON 26 OCCASIONS

O.                                14•

       THROUGH 22 PIECES OF LEGISLATION AGAINST 54 SEPARATE 
       SCHEMES•

       IN ADDITION TO DIRECTLY ATTACKING PARTICULAR SCHEMES OF 
       AVOIDANCE, WE HAVE INCORPORATED - THROUGH PART IV A OF 
       THE INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT - A GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE 
       PROVISION•

            -    A KEY FEATURE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS THAT
                 BLATANT, ARTIFICIAL AND CONTRIVED ARRANGEMENTS 
                 CAUGHT IN ITS NET ARE STRUCK DOWN AS FROM 27 
                 MAY 1981 WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED

                 -  WHATEVER DATE IN THE FUTURE THEY ARE
                    DISCOVERED

            -    AND ADDITIONAL TAX EQUAL TO DOUBLE THE TAX 
                 SOUGHT TO BE AVOIDED IS AUTOMATICALLY PAYABLE 
                 ON ANY SCHEME STRUCK DOWN BY PART IV A•

       WE HAVE ALSO INTRODUCED THE CRIMES (TAXATION OFFENCES) 
       ACT 1980

            -    WHICH PROVIDES GAOL TERMS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS, 
                 AND FINES OF UP TO $50,000•

            -    FOR CERTAIN SCHEMES WHICH SEEK TO REDUCE OR

            5

     REMOVE THE CAPACITY OF A COMPANY OR TRUSTEE TO 
     PAY TAX-

AND THROUGH CHANGES IN THE ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT WE 
HAVE REQUIRED THE COURTS TO HAVE REGARD FOR THE 
INTENTION OF THE LAW
  -  RATHER THAN FOR FINER POINTS OF ITS LANGUAGE•

THE GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT THAT TOGETHER THESE MEASURES 
ARE WORKING

  -  AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO GREATLY DIMINISH 
     THE INCIDENCE OF TAX AVOIDANCE•

BUT LET THERE BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING•

     IF THE MEASURES WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN DON'T GO 
     FAR ENOUGH TO STOP PARTICULAR UNACCEPTABLE
     PRACTICES,

  -  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE
     FURTHER ACTION•

AND THIS ACTION MIGHT WELL RESORT TO AN EXTENSION OF THE 
USE OF LIMITED RETROSPECTIVITY•
