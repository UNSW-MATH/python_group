AT THE LAST PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, ON 4 MAY, A DECISION WAS 
MADE ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE RAISED BY THE 
COMMONWEALTH WHICH WOULD BE PASSED TO THE STATES IN THE 
FINANCIAL YEAR 1981-82.

FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A FORMULA IN OPERATION 
WHICH SETS OUT HOW THE TOTAL SUM IS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG 
THE STATES.

THIS FORMULA HAS EVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF STATES SINCE 1942, 
WHEN THE COMMONWEALTH FIRST INTRODUCED UNIFORM TAXATION 
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.

PRIOR TO THAT TIME, EACH STATE RAISED ITS OWN INCOME TAXES, 
AND THERE WERE IN FACT DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF TAX 
WHICH WERE REQUIRED IN THE VARIOUS STATES.

IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT TO DECIDE HOW TO DIVIDE THE 
MONIES BETWEEN STATES
  -    A DIVISION ON A PURE POPULATION BASIS WOULD CLEARLY 
       DISADVANTAGE THE SMALLER STATES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE 
       FAR LARGER AREAS TO LOOK AFTER
  -    AND A DIVISION IN TERMS OF THE TAX CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
       EACH STATE WOULD PRESUMABLY TAD TO THE RICH STATES GETTING 
       RICHER AND THE POOR STATES GETTING POORER.

                 2.

THE TAX SHARING FORMULA WAS LAST REVISED IN A SUBSTANTIAL 
WAY IN 1959 (CHECK FACT)
  - AND SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR CHANGES IN
    THE DEMOGRAPHY AND THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF AUSTRALIA 
    AND OF THE VARIOUS STATES.

A NEW REVIEW OF THE FORMULA FOR TAX SHARING HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN
IN THE LAST YEARS BY THE GRANTS COMMISSION, WHICH
HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MATTER.

AND THIS REVIEW IS DUE TO BE PUBLISHED AND AVAILABLE EARLY 
IN JUNE
  - PERHAPS 8TH OR 9TH.

NOBODY KNOWS WHAT DIFFERENCE, IF ANY, IT WILL RECOMMEND IN 
THE TAX SHARING ARRANGEMENT.

BUT IT IS ALSO A UNIVERSAL BELIEF THAT IT WILL PROPOSE SOME 
CHANGES IN THE RELEVANT SHARES AS BETWEEN STATES.

AND OF COURSE IT CANNOT RECOMMEND A GREATER SHARE TO SOME 
STATES WITHOUT RECOMMENDING A SMALLER SHARE FOR OTHERS.

IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT SOME STATES ARE LOOKING FORWARD WITH A 
DEGREE OF OPTIMISM TO THE REVIEW, AND OTHERS WITH A DEGREE 
OF PESSIMISM.

               3.


THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE THAT IS TO BE HELD ON 19 JUNE WILL 
BE CONCERNED PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS AND RESPOND TO THE REVIEW
 - TO DECIDE WHICH RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADOPT, AND THE 
   WAY IN WHICH TO ADOPT THEM.

IF THE REPORT DOES RECOMMEND MORE FOR SOME STATES AND LESS 
FOR OTHERS
 - AND IF THE REPORT WERE SIMPLY TO BE ADOPTED FORTHWITH
 - THEN THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE THAT SOME STATES WOULD 
   BE PLACED IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION FROM A BUDGETARY 
   POINT OF VIEW.

AND THE STATES WHICH WERE THE BENEFICIARIES WOULD SUDDENLY 
FIND THEMSELVES IN A GREATLY IMPROVED POSITION, TO THE 
EXTENT WHILE THEY COULD DOUBTLESS MAKE GOOD USE OF THE MONEY 
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THEIR GAIN CANNOT 
BE NEARLY SO GREAT AS THE OTHER STATES' LOSS.

THERE IS A CERTAIN SENSE IN WHICH THE DIVISION OF MONIES
AS BETWEEN THE STATES IS PRINCIPALLY A MATTER FOR THE STATES 
THEMSELVES TO WORK OUT.

BUT THE ISSUE IS ONE OF MAJOR CONCERN TO ALL AUSTRALIANS
AND TO AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMONWEALTH 
SHOULD BE ABLE
 - INDEED AS AN OBLIGATION
 - TO TRY TO ASSIST
 - ASSUMING THAT NEW RELATIVITIES ARE RECOMMENDED 
 - IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, THE BRINGING IN OR PHASING IN, OF
   WHATEVER NEW ARRANGEMENTS ARE DECIDED UPON.

                4.


FOR WHILE THE ISSUE IS ONE WHICH CONCERNS ALL AUSTRALIANS
 - WHICH MAY WELL INDEED HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE FUTURE
   WELL BEING OF AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE,
 - AND WHILE THESE RELATIVITIES ARE THUS A MATTER OF NATIONAL
   CONCERN, AFFECTING THE NATIONAL INTEREST
 - THE INTERESTS OF PARTICULAR STATES, VIEWED SOLELY FROM 
   EACH STATE'S OWN PERSPECTIVE ARE LIKELY TO BE IRRECONCILABLY 
   OPPOSED.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE FAIR THAT ANY STATE 
SHOULD HAVE TO FACE A SUBSTANTIAL AND IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN 
ITS RELATIVE SHARE OF COMMONWEALTH FUNDS.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY STATE, VIEWING THE MATTER DISPASSIONATELY, 
WOULD FEEL THAT SUCH A COURSE OF ACTION WAS FAIR, OR IN THE 
BEST INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA.

BUT TO GIVE MORE TO THOSE STATES WHICH ARE ALLOCATED MORE
UNDER THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS, WITHOUT GIVING LESS TO THOSE STATES 
WHICH ARE ALLOCATED LESS
 - WOULD MAKE THE TAXPAYERS THE LOSER.

AND I HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THE COMMONWEALTH IS NOT 
PREPARED TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

PLAINLY, THE SOLUTION MUST BE TO PROCEED GRADUALLY.

A MEANS MUST BE FOUND WHICH WILL BRING IN THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS
OVER TIME

              5



 - GIVING THE STATES WHICH WILL RECEIVE A SMALLER SHARE A 
   CHANCE TO ADJUST
 - AND THE STATES RECEIVING A LARGER SHARE THE CHANCE TO 
   MAKE FULLY EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MONIES CONCERNED.

A COURSE OF ACTION, A WAY TO PROCEEDING MUST BE DEVISED WHICH 
THE PREMIERS CAN AGREE TO.

THAT IS THE OVERRIDING INTEREST OF THIS COUNTRY.

PREMIERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE A MAJOR OBLIGATION TO THEIR OWN 
STATES, AND TO LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THEIR STATES.

BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WHEN THE PREMIERS NEXT MEET IN CANBERRA, 
WE SHALL ALL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR MINDS, WITH THE GREATEST 
DEGREE OF FARSIGHTEDNESS POSSIBLE, TO WORKING OUT AND AGREEING 
UPON
 - A FORMULA WHICH IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA 
   AS A WHOLE, AND THUS OF EVERY STATE IN THE BROADEST 
   SENSE
 - AND A WAY OF GRADUALLY BRINGING THIS FORMULA INTO
   OPERATION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH WILL MINIMISE ANY 
   DISLOCATIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE OCCUR AND MAXIMISE 
   ADVANTAGES IN THE SHORT TERM AS WELL AS THE LONG TERM.

THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE WORKING IN THE 
NEXT FEW WEEKS TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THIS RESULT TS IN FACT 
ACHIEVED.
