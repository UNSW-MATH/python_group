PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK
FOR
SUNDAY, 29 AUGUST, 1982

IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT IT TOOK JOHN HOWARD AN HOUR 
AND A HALF TO PRESENT THE FEDERAL BUDGET TO PARLIAMENT 
RECENTLY.

IT IS A VERY FULL DOCUMENT AND CONTAINS SO MUCH OF 
IMPORTANCE TO EVERYONE IN AUSTRALIA THAT I SHOULD LIKE 
TO RUN OVER SOME OF ITS IMPORTANT FEATURES, PARTICULARLY 
THOSE THAT AFFECT US HERE IN WANNON.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE BUDGET IS DIRECTED AT HELPING 
AUSTRALIANS IN THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC PERIOD WE ARE NOW 
EXPERIENCING.

MUCH OF THE DIFFICULTY STEMS FROM OVERSEAS - DEPRESSED 
ECONOMIES IN THE NATIONS WHO BUY OUR PRODUCTS, HIGH 
INTEREST RATES WHICH ARE REFLECTED HERE AND WHICH MAKE 
PAYING OFF HOME LOANS SO MUCH HARDER.

FROM 1 NOVEMBER, THE BUDGET WILL HELP CONSIDERABLY WITH 
THESE PROBLEMS.

SUBSTANTIAL TAX CUTS FOR ALL TAXPAYERS WILL COME INTO 
EFFECT THEN.

AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WILL BE AN EXTENDED REBATE 
SCHEME FOR EVERYONE PAYING OFF THEIR OWN HOME.

           2.

THE SPOUSE REBATE IS BEING INCREASED.

FAMILY ALLOWANCES FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND CHILDREN WILL 
GO UP BY HALF FROM THAT DATE.

EVEN ALLOWING FOR INCREASES IN INDIRECT TAXES, THE 
AVERAGE ONE-INCOME FAMILY WILL BE ABOUT $17 A WEEK 
BETTER OFF IN NOVEMBER.

IF YOURS IS A VERY LOW INCOME FAMILY WITHOUT PENSIONS OR 
BENEFITS, THEN THERE IS A SPECIAL INCOME SUPPLEMENT 
BEING INTRODUCED NEXT YEAR WORTH $10 A WEEK FOR EACH 
DEPENDENT CHILD.

THERE ARE ABOUT 14,000 FAMILIES WITH 30,000 CHILDREN IN 
WANNON, ALL OF WHOM WILL BENEFIT.

THEN THERE ARE INCREASES IN STUDENT ALLOWANCES TO HELP 
LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AT SCHOOLS, 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LONGER IN ORDER TO GAIN BETTER 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

ABOUT 400 CHILDREN OF FAMILIES IN WANNON SHOULD BE 
HELPED TO STAY AT SECONDARY SCHOOLS ALONE NEXT YEAR.

MORE MONEY IS BEING SPENT TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT AND 
TRAINING PROGRAMS BY 21 PER CENT NEXT YEAR.

PENSIONS WILL RISE FROM 1 NOVEMBER AND WE HAVE ABOUT

11,000 PENSIONERS IN THE AREA.3

IN LINE WITH MOVEMENTS IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THE 
STANDARD OR SINGLE RATE FOR AGED PENSIONERS WILL RISE BY 
$3.10 tO $77.25 A WEEK, WHILE THE COMBINED MARRIED RATE 
WILL INCREASE BY $5.20 TO $128.80.

PENSIONERS AND SUPPORTING PARENTS WILL BE ABLE TO EARN 
MORE WITHOUT LOSING THEIR PENSIONS - UP TO $30 A WEEK 
FOR SINGLE PENSIONERS AND $50 FOR PENSIONER COUPLES.

THE PENSION WILL START TO REDUCE WHEN TOTAL INCOME 
REACHES $107.25 A WEEK FOR A SINGLE PENSIONER AND 
$178.80 FOR A MARRIED COUPLE.

IT WON'T CUT OUT ALTOGETHER UNTIL WEEKLY INCOMES REACH 
$184.50 FOR SINGLES AND $307.60 FOR MARRIED PENSIONERS.

THE INCOME LIMITS FOR FRINGE BENEFIT ENTITLEMENTS 
INCLUDING PENSIONER HEALTH BENEFITS WILL ALSO BE RAISED 
- TO $54 A WEEK FOR SINGLE PENSIONERS AND $90 FOR
PENSIONER COUPLES.

THERE WILL ALSO BE A SPECIAL PENSIONER TAX REBATE TO A 
MAXIMUM OF $250 A YEAR.

THIS MEANS THAT A PENSIONER CAN HAVE A TOTAL INCOME 
INCLUDING A PENSION OF $5429 A YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO 
PAY ANY TAX.

            4.



 BOVE THAT, THE REBATE WILL BE PHASED DOWN UNTIL IT CUTS 

 OUT WHEN A PENSIONER'S INCOME REACHES $7429.




 MARRIED PENSIONERS WILL EACH BE ENTITLED TO THE SAME 

 REBATE AS A SINGLE PENSIONER.




 SINCE THE REBATE TAKES EFFECT ON NOVEMBER 1, AND 

 THEREFORE WILL APPLY FOR ONLY EIGHT MONTHS OF THE 

 1982-83 YEAR, THE REBATE FOR THIS YEAR WILL AMOUNT TO

 TWO-THIRDS OF THE FULL YEAR RATE.
 THE COMBINED CASH BENEFITS AND REDUCTIONS IN TAX FROM


 NOVEMBER THIS YEAR RANGE FROM UP TO $12.79 A WEEK FOR A 

 SINGLE PENSIONER TO $17.08 FOR A COUPLE, TOGETHER WITH

 THE EXTENSION OF FRINGE BENEFIT ENTITLEMENTS.




 THERE ARE 4,500 VETERANS AND DEPENDANTS IN WANNON 

 RECEIVING REPATRIATION PENSIONS, AND THEY WILL BENEFIT 

 FROM THE IMPROVED BUDGET PROVISIONS.




SO WILL THE DISABLED - THE 2000 INVALID PENSIONERS, THE 

HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THE SICK.




AN INCREASE TO $10 A WEEK INCREASE IN THE INCENTIVE 

ALLOWANCE FOR THOSE IN SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT WILL ASSIST

THE PEOPLE IN THE HAMILTON AND WARRNAMBOOL SHELTERED 

WORKSHOPS.

             5.

  E ALLOWANCE IS ALSO BEING EXTENDED TO HANDICAPPED 
 ADULTS UNDERGOING APPROVED TRAINING OR ACTIVITY THERAPY 

 IN CENTRES SUCH AS THE MULLERATERONG CENTRE IN HAMILTON, 

 HAMILTON ABILITY INDUSTRIES, WARRNAMBOOL SHELTERED 

 WORKSHOP TASKFORCE AND THE YALUNDA DAY TRAINING CENTRE 

 IN WARRNAMBOOL.


 THE BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES FUNDS FOR A NEW REGIONAL 
 REHABILITATION UNIT FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AT HAMILTON.


 INCREASED COMMONWEALTH FUNDS FOR WELFARE HOUSING WILL

 HELP TO BUILD 12 ELDERLY PERSONS UNITS AT PORTLAND AND 

 10 AT HAMILTON AS WELL AS 12 VILLAS IN HAMILTON, 7 IN 
 WARRNAMBOOL AND 3 IN STAWELL.


 SEVERAL ORGANISATIONS CARING FOR THE FRAIL AGED IN
 HOSTELS IN ARARAT, CASTERTON, STAWELL, PORTLAND, 

 WARRNAMBOOL, HAMILTON AND HEYWOOD WILL BENEFIT FROM THE 
 BUDGET INCREASES IN PERSONAL CARE SUBSIDY.

 ASSISTANCE HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASED TO HELP PEOPLE IN 



 NURSING HOMES AND THOSE RELYING ON MEALS ON WHEELS AND
 HOME NURSING SERVICES.



IMPORTANT TO WANNON ARE THE UNTIED GENERAL REVENUE 

GRANTS WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH PAYS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

THIS FINANCIAL YEAR, THE LOCAL COUNCILS IN THE WANNON 
AREA WILL RECEIVE $6.7 MILLION - THAT'S AN INCREASE OF 
ALMOST 22 PER CENT.

ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ARE THE BUDGET PROVISIONS FOR ROAD 
BUILDING•

ON TOP OF THE CURRENT FIVE YEAR PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE IS 
THE NEW AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
WHICH BY 1988 WILL GIVE AUSTRALIA A SYSTEM OF ROADS WE 
CAN BE VERY PROUD OF.

OF COURSE, THIS EMPHASIS ON ROADS MEANS A GREAT DEAL OF
WORK AND JOBS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.            (         .....Aal.1 f `'J
IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR, A MASSIVE $200 MILLION IS 
EXPECTED TO BE SPENT ON LOCAL ROADS ALONE, AND $40
MILLION WILL BE SPENT IN VICTORIA, AN INCREASE OF ALMOST 
A QUARTER OVER LAST YEAR.

IN ADDITION, VICTORIANS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE 
COMMONWEALTH'S $35 MILLION SPECIAL PAYMENT TO UPGRADE 
VICTORIA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

WITH FARMING SO IMPORTANT IN WANNON, IT IS WORTH NOTING 
THE 45 PER CENT INCREASE TO $310 MILLION IN THE BUDGET'S

                _7

NET ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL INDUSTRIES•

FARMERS, OF COURSE, GAIN ALONG WITH AUSTRALIANS 
GENERALLY FROM THE TAX AND FAMILY BENEFITS•

THEY MUST ALSO INVEST IN NEW PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TO 
MAINTAIN THEIR EFFICIENCY AND THEY WILL BE ENCOURAGED 
CONSIDERABLY NOW THAT NEW PRIMARY PRODUCTION PLANT IS 
GENERALLY DEPRECIABLE OVER 3 YEARS•

THE BUDGET AND THE ASSOCIATED INITIATIVES WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ARE DESIGNED TO ASSIST AND 
STIMULATE BUSINESS IN A DIFFICULT ECONOMIC PERIOD, AND 
AT THE SAME TIME TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE•

ONE IMPORTANT EFFECT IS TO INCREASE PEOPLE'S INCOMES 
WITHOUT THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF LARGE WAGE AND SALARY 
RISES•

RESTRAINT IN WAGE CLAIMS IS CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE 
ECONOMIC WELL-BEING•

THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE BUDGET HELP TO REDUCE 
GREATLY THE PRESSURE AND THE NEED FOR THOSE RISES•

WE CAN BUILD ON THE BASIS ESTABLISHED IN THE BUDGET BY 
THE TAX CUTS, THE HOME LOAN INTEREST REBATE, THE FAMILY

ALLOWANCES, INCOME SUPPLEMENTS AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE•

IN WANNON, AND THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, EVERYONE STANDS TO 
GAIN FROM A SENSIBLE, CO-OPERATIVE NATIONAL APPROACH•
