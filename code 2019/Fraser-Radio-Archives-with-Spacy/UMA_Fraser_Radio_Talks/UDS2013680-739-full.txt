pRI"-IE MINISTER'S
ELECTORATE TALK
27 JUNE 1982

THERE WERE THREE MAIN ISSUES AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE 
AND LOAN COUNCIL

  - FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE STATES FOLLOWING THE 
    GRANTS COMMISSION REPORT

  - GIVING THE STATES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN 
    ELECTRICITY BORROWINGS

  - AND GREATER COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITY IN NATIONAL 
    ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT•

          ALL STATES HAVE REC EDP
SIGNIFICANT REAL INCREASES IN THEIR FUNDS

  - ON PRESENT ESTIMATES THE OVERALL INCREASE ON
    LAST YEAR'S BASE GRANTS WILL BE 17.1%

    AND THEY COULD ONLY HAVE RECEIVED MORE THROUGH 
    HIGHER TAXES•

THE COMMONWEALTH'S PACKAGE TO THE LOAN COUNCIL PRODUCED 
SOME HISTORIC DECISIONS•

GIVING THE STATES FREEDOM TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THEIR 
ELECTRICITY BORROWINGS, AND TO SET THE INTEREST RATES 
ON THEM WILL MAKE THE STATES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN 
ELECTRICITY PROGRAMS

                                                         2.                                D4

                     AND THAT GREATER DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY WILL 
                     BE WELCOMED BY THE COMMUNITY.

THE PREMIERS ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THEIR ELECTRICITY AUTHORITIES
           -          TO PUBLISH AUDITS AND TARIFF RATES AND SO END
                      ANY SECRET DEALS ON SPECIAL ELECTRICITY 
                      TARIFFS•

THIS INFORMATION WILL OPEN THESE AUTHORITIES UP TO FAR 
MORE PUBLIC SCRUTINY

                      AND HELP IN MAKING THE STATES MORE RESPONSIBLE 
                      FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN A REAL SENSE.

THE LOAN COUNCIL GAVE THE COMMONWEALTH GREATER 
FLEXIBILITY TO USE INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE VITAL IN 
 NATIONAL ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

                      THROUGH A TENDER SYSTEM FOR SELLING 
                      COMMONWEALTH BONDS, AS RECOMMENDED BY THE 
                      CAMPBELL COMMITTEE

                      AND THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO SET TERMS 
                      AND CONDITIONS FOR THE SALE OF AUSTRALIA 
                      SAVINGS BONDS.

             NO AUSTRALIAN WOULD WANT TO IMPOSE THAT SORT 
             OF HARDSHIP ON THE SMALLER STATES.



THE GRANTS COMMISSION ITSELF SUGGESTED PHASING IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS

             AND THE COMMONWEALTH HAS GUARANTEED TO THE 
             THREE SMALLER STATES WHO STOOD TO LOSE THAT 
             THEY WILL RECEIVE SOME REAL INCREASE IN THEIR 
             TAX SHARING FUNDS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

BUT NOW, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF              ,'.rf NCREASE THE
CAIN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS THREATENING TO REDUCE HOSPITAL 
SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THREE SPECIFIC FEDERAL 
ELECTORATES, INCLUDING WANNON.

NEVER BEFORE HAVE THE PEOPLE OF PARTICULAR ELECTORATES 
BEEN THREATENED IN THIS WAY


             USING CONSTITUENTS IN THIS CALLOUS WAY IS A 
             NEW LOW IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS

    -    AND THE CAIN LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL SURELY PAY

         THE PRICE OF THIS EXPLICIT DISCRIMINATION, 

         BECAUSE ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS WILL NOT STAND 

         FOR THIS KIND OF TACTICS BY GOVERNMENTS•



BEFORE I CONCLUDE TONIGHT, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 

THE BRISBANE GAMES



    -    AND MR WHITLAM'S TRIP TO AFRICA•



THE COMMONWEALTH GAMES ARE ONE OF THE WORLDS GREAT 

SPORTING EVENTS



         AND AUSTRALIANS WERE DELIGHTED WHEN ANY SHADOW
                                  Zy
         OF BOYCOTT WAS LIFTED LAST MAYkTHE GAMES

         FEDERATION'S AGREEMENT TO FULL PARTICIPATION•



MR WHITLAM MAY HAVE DENIED ANY INTENTION TO ADVISE AN

AFRICAN BOYCOTT OF THE GAMES77



         BUT HE ALSO SAID HE WAS 'VERY MUCH CRITICISING 

         AUSTRALIA"



    -    HE AGREED THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THE

         AFRICANS ''REPRESENT A TOOL TO BRING ABOUT 

         DOMESTIC CHANGE IN AUSTRALIA"



    -    AND SO FAR FROM REFUSING TOE A BOYCOTT, 

         HE SAID HE WOULD "TELL THE AFRICANS THAT IT IS

           6•     D4
    UP TO THEM TO DECIDE HOW THEY CAN MAKE THEIR 
    VIEWS ON THE TREATMENT OF ABORRIGINES KNOWN'•

I LEAVE IT UP TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA TO JUDGE WHAT 
MR WHITLAM IS REALLY ABOUT ON THIS VISIT•
