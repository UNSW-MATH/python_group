                                       Last week Sir Eric Harrison resigned from the House

 of RelDresentatives to take up his appointment as Australian High
 Commissioner in the United Kingdom.                                                                                He had been in the Common- 
 wealth Parliament ,witha short break a few years ao,for about 25 
 years and in the last few years of his career had acted ae as an
.able and loyal lieutenant to the Prime Ministeri                                                                                                         6n his last

 night in Canberra. the Joint Government Parties. (the Liberal Party 
 and the Country Party) gave Sir Eric and Lady Harrison a farewell 
 dinner and on behalf of the Parties, Sir Arthur Fadden made a
 presentation to Sir Eric.
                                       During the last week we were concerned with several
 small but in their own sphere importent bills.

 was passed out of the direct contrpl of                                                                                     e Governme*--lnto the
 hands of the Nati                                                Unive                   ty               In recent ‘y,t1rE3 the work of
 the Lniversit has                                                                  e more and mere.of a research character

        t anal t ver ty which unlike, /he other Australian Universities 
 is es nti ly a place for r search.
                                       A bill was passed which ratifies the new Commonwealth-
 State Housing Agreement.                                                        Under this Bill 430,000,000 are granted 
 the States for Hou, ing purposes. In the past all this money could 
 be used by the States to build their own State owned houses for 
 rental ourposes, but the Government believes there are a large 
 proportion of people who instead of renting a home would prefer
 to buy one if they can borrow the money on just and fair terms two
 Therefore in the first/yearsof this Bill, 20.; of the total sum 
 must bd :Jade over to Co-operative Housing Societies and in the

 At the same time this m.ney is loaned to the States on e slightly 
 lower rate of interest than prevails for general loan funds.

                              There was then the War Service Land Settlement Loan
 Bill for 1956.                        This Bill provides for the raising of moneys 
 totalling £Bi . for capital e<pendit ure. Out of this sum tiri11 come 
 the extra grant to ew South pales and Victoria of £1 for every
 £2 that those States spend on Soldier Settlement.                                                                  This [rant 
was originally made about two years ago and was outside the
 original Commonwealth-State agreeri. nt concerning Soldier Settlement,
 }        It was begun in an effort to get general Soldier Settlement 
 completed before many returned servicemen became too old to start 
 life anew on the land.
                             In 1955/56 £1,610,000 was made vaila blen to Victoria
 and £1,570,000 to hew South Wales.                                        ~-                   -- -              -..

                             Ther as another small Bill which may w ell have large
effects in a few years time.                                         Since th, war it has been very 
difficult for =II hospital construction to ,e maintained at a rate
demanded by the growth of our population.                                                        Because of this
cases are being discharged from hospitals at the earliest possible 
time but many of these cases, among which are many elderly people, 
require nursing attention in their own homes and very often they are 
happier to receive this attention in their own homes than go into a 
hospital.

                               t the present time there are about 150 District 
nurses employed by home Nursing Itssvaiatizmx and it is estimated thatorganisations
these 150 nurses save about 900 hospital beds                                                            year.             In a modern
hospital £7,O~3a: rust be allowed for each bed and the cost of main-
tenance of thap bed is not less than £3 a day.                                                                The present 
150 nurses, tì t has been reliably estimated save £i . a year. 
Because of these considerations the Government has decided to 
subsidise home nursing.

                   Broadly speaking the Commonwealth's policy will be
  to pay a subsidy to nursing or ann s ti ns that extend                    tr•    :f_
---14-0—the number of nurses working and 1         e subsidy will roughly be
  equal to the additional salary required to employ new nurses.
  If a staff is increased from 10 to 15, then the subsidy will roughly
  equal the salary of the 5 additional nurses.                New organisations 
  employing home hurses will also be entitled to a subsidy worked on
  a slightly different basis.             These organisations at the present 
  time receive a State subsidy and the Commonwealth Bill also provides 
  that the Commonwealth subsidy shall not in any case be greater than 
  the State Government aubsidy, 1rd it is troposed to consult with the 
  State Government about the effective working of this new Bill.
                      This Bill has been a small measure and has not ;eceived 
  a great deal of publicity but it could effect great savings in the
  future.      At the same time it will help to bring betted. nursing 
  into the homes of a great many people who require it.
                       I believe it may well be as important as the 
  Federal Government's previous legislation which subsidises the 
  homes built for elderly people which has made it possible far, rmy
  organisations to establish homes for the aged which would,verwise        ^
  4agect have been built.
