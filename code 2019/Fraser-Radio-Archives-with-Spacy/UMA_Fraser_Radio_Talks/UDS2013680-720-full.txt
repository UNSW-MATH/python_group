DURING THE WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE MEETING AT THE SYDNEY 
OPERA HOUSE LAST WEEK
  - THE GREAT BARRIER, REEF, THE KAKADU NATIONAL PARK IN
    ARNHEM LAND, AND THE WILLANDRA LAKES REGION IN WESTERN 
    N.S.W. WERE INSCRIBED ON THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST,

THIS LIST IS MADE UP OF NATURAL SITES AND MAN-MADE PROPERTIES 
WHICH ARE JUDGED BY THE COMMITTEE, USING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, 
TO BE OF OUTSTANDING UNIVERSAL VALUE TO THE WHOLE OF MANKIND,

THE SITES AND PROPERTIES PREVIOUSLY ON THE LIST RANGE FROM THE 
PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT TO THE GRAND CANYON IN THE UNITED STATES, 
FROM THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES TO THE KATMANDU VALLEY, AND 
FROM THE ANCIENT CITY OF DAMASCUS TO THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
IN EQUADOR,

THE BARRIER REEF, THE KAKADU PARK AND THE WILLANDRA LAKES REGION 
ARE WORTHY ADDITIONS TO A LIST WHICH NOW NUMBERS 111 SITES AND 
PROPERTIES RIGHT AROUND THE WORLD
  - AND TWO OTHER PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ADDITIONS TO THE
    LIST AT THE SYDNEY MEETING WERE THE FAMOUS SERENGETI 
    GAME PARK IN TANZANIA, AND THE GLACIERS NATIONAL PARK, 
    A VAST ALPINE AREA AND GLACIER IN ARGENTINA,

THE WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE ITSELF IS MADE UP OF 21 OF THE 61 
COUNTRIES WHICH ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE U.N. WORLD HERITAGE 
CONVENTION,

             2.
THE WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE FIRST MET IN PARIS IN 1977
 - AND THE FACT THAT THE 1981 MEETING WAS HELD IN THIS 
   COUNTRY IS A TRIBUTE TO AUSTRALIA'S CONCERN FOR 
   CONSERVATION AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,

THE OFFICIAL UNESCO REPRESENTATIVE AT THE MEETING SPOKE
IN GLOWING TERMS OF HOW MUCH AUSTRALIA IS DOING TO PRESERVE 
THE NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
 - AND OF THE CONSTANT DESIRE OF AUSTRALIA TO PROMOTE 
   INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION IN THIS FIELD,

THE INTEREST OF AUSTRALIANS IN CONSERVATION AND HERITAGE ISSUES 
IS LONG-STANDING
 - AND IT IS BROADLY BASED.

SOME FIELD NATURALIST CLUBS DATE BACK TO THE EARLY PART OF THIS 
CENTURY
 - THE NATIONAL TRUST MOVEMENT HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT 
   80,000
 - AND THE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF NATURE CONSERVATION BODIES 
   RUNS TO A QUARTER OF A MILLION,

THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS PUT ITS WEIGHT BEHIND MANY 
MAJOR CONSERVATION AND HERITAGE INITIATIVES,

            3,

 - AND OUR CHILDREN WILL INHERIT A BETTER AUSTRALIA, 
   AND TO AN EXTENT A BETTER WORLD, AS A RESULT OF WHAT 
   THE GOVERNMENT HAS ACHIEVED,

WE PROHIBITED SAND MINING ON FRASER ISLAND

 - WE HAVE BANNED WHALING IN AUSTRALIAN WATERS AND HAVE 
   SUPPORTED BANNING 'WHALING COMPLETELY

 - WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED GRANTS AND RESEARCH 
   IN MARINE SCIENCE

 - WE HAVE ACTED UPON THE REPORT OF THE FOX INQUIRY INTO
   URANIUM

 - WE HAVE WORKED TOWARDS THE PRESERVATION OF ANTARCTICA 
   AND THE PRESERVATION OF ANTARCTIC SEALS

 - WE HAVE WORKED TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AND ENDANGERED
   SPECIES AND FOR NATURE CONSERVATION IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC

 - WE WERE THE FIRST PARTY TO THE CONVENTION ON WETLANDS
   OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE

 - WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE AUSTRALIANA FUND

 - WE HAVE ASSISTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WORLD 
   WILDLIFE FUND IN AUSTRALIA,

            4.

AUSTRALIA'S CONSERVATION STRATEGY, WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH 
THE BALANCE BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION, IS 
EXPECTED TO BE FINALISED BY THE END OF 1982,

I WOULD ADD THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS TO JUNE THE AREA OF 
NATIONAL PARKLAND HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED, WITH NEW PARKS 
IN EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA

 - AND THE TOTAL AREA OF 31 MILLION HECTARES IS ALMOST
   HALF AS BIG AGAIN AS THE ENTIRE AREA OF VICTORIA,

EVENTS SUCH AS THE SYDNEY MEETING OF THE WORLD HERITAGE 
COMVITTEE NOT ONLY PUT A WORLD SPOTLIGHT ON AUSTRALIA

 - THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE PRIDE YE CAN TAKE IN OUR
   GREAT COUNTRY

 - AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PASS ON
   TO OUR CHILDREN A HERITAGE AND ENVIRONMENT THAT IS 
   JUST AS HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL AND ENRICHING AS WE ENJOY 
   OURSELVES,
