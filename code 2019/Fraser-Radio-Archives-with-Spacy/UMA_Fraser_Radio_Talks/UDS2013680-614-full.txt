          A few hours before Mr Snedden brought down the 
     Budget, he was asked how he would describe it. He summed it 
     up in one word - "responsible".


          I think that was a pretty fair description.


          When there is too much pressure on the economy and 
     all the resources of industry and labor are stretched to 
     the full, the Government has a duty to try to take the heat 
     out of the economy. At those times, the Government should 
     collect more revenue from people than it spends, and in the 
     past the present Government has done that.


          However, at the moment we are in the opposite 
     situation. There is unused capacity in industry. For months 
     we have taken successive measures to achieve a greater rate 
     of activity in the economy. Unemployment has still remained 
     higher than we would like it, although our position is much 
     better than many other countries, such as Britain and Canada.


          These are some of the reasons which have required 
     the Government to take such substantial steps in the budget to 
•    improve confidence and activity in the economy.


          We have concentrated much of our attention on the 
     family man, and most of the budgetary concessions will benefit 
     him very greatly. Let me look at them.


          Personal income tax will be reduced by an average 
     of 10 per cent. This comes on top of the 22 per cent cut 
     in income tax last April. Perhaps the most important feature 
     of the latest reductions is that the greatest advantage will 
     be gained by those people on the lowest incomes. Everyone 
     earning below $5500 a year will be subject to reductions 
     of more than 10 per cent. For instance, at $4000, the 
     reduction will be 12.4 per cent. Above $5500, the reduction




                                .../2

                        - 2 -


        will be less than 10 per cent.

               Mr Snedden gave a good example of how the family 
        man will benefit from the tax cuts to an even greater extent 
        than other people. A man with a wife and two children to 
        support who earns $98 a week pays about $16 a week in income 
        tax. Under our proposals, this will be cut by $2.75 a week 
        or 17 per cent. If he has other concessional deductions, 
        his present tax bill will be cut by a larger percentage than 
        that.
•              If his income were $60 a week, his tax would be 
        reduced by nearly a quarter, from $5.50 to $4.20 a week.

               At the same time, the minimum taxable income for 
        individuals will be raised from $417 to $1041 a year, so 
        that about 600,000 taxpayers will be exempted from tax 
        liability altogether. Many of them are part-time employees, 
        including married women and students working in vacations.

               The Government will also relieve some of the heavy 
        burden on the family man by increasing all dependents' 
•       allowances by $52. For example, the claim for a wife is now 
        $364.

               I must mention the changes in estate duty. All 
        exemption levels have been doubled, so that, for instance, 
        a suburban estate of up to $40,000 going wholly to close 
        relatives will attract no duty at all.

               Such an estate with a net value of $60,000 would 
        have duty reduced from $3500 to $937. Larger suburban 
        estates of, say, $150,000 will have reductions of duty from 
        $25,500 to $21,642.

                                            .../3

         Primary production estates of up to $48,000 will now 
     be exempt of duty. A $60,000 estate will attract c_uty of 
     only $225 instead of $1462, a $100,000 estate duty of $2762 
     instead of $5462, and an estate of $150,000 duty of $10,242 
     instead of $13,897.

         While the rises in pensions of $1.75 for a single 
    pensioner and $2.50 for a married couple may not directly 
    affect the family man, nor the decision to ease immediately 
    the means test, our announced intention to abolish the means 
•   test over the next three years will have a substantial impact.

         The family man will know that When he retires, he 
    will be eligible for an age pension, an entitlement that many 
    people will regard as their right since they have paid their 
    taxes throughout their entire working life.

         I cannot overemphasise the importance of the new 
    education measures for which I have particular responsibility. 
    Our scholarship proposals are far reaching. For instance, 
    the Commonwealth will now be supporting through scholarships 
    at any one time, more than 120,000 students throughout 
•   Australia, a rise of more than 50,000.

         There will now be 25,000 new secondary scholarships 
    awarded each year instead of the present 10,000, thereby 
    greatly assisting families with the education of chilc_ren in 
    the final two years of secondary school. Each award will
    carry a basic allowance of $150 a year, an a further allowance 
    of up to $250 a year will be available subject to consideration 
    of family income. Thus, some of the less well off families





                          .../4

                4


     will be eligible for up to $400 a year for each of their 
     children in the last two years of secondary school.

         There will be 1000 more open entrance university 
     scholarships, 1000 more later year university scholarships, 
     and 2000 more advanced education scholarships. In addition, 
     there will be increases in the living allowances and a 
     substantial relaxation of the means test applicable to those 
     living allowances. Major beneficiaries of these changes 
     will be families in country areas whose sons and daughters 
     have to live away from home to pursue their studies.
•        Another useful concession in the budget is the 
     proposal to allow an income tax deduction of up to $400 for 
     expenditure by a taxpayer on his own education where the 
     expenditure is related to his income-producing activities but 
     is not allowable under the existing law.

         Buying a house is perhaps the family man's major 
     financial transaction, and his main aspiration. Under the 
     budget, the maximum value of a home which may attract a 
     grant will be increased from $17,500 to $22,500. The maximum 
     grant itself will also be increased from $500 on savings 
     of $1500 to $750 on savings of $2250.
•        There are several other aspects of the budget which 
     will benefit families directly and indirectly. For instance, 
     we have announced that the Commonwealth will assist in the 
     establishment and running of child care centres operating on 
     a non-profit basis.
         We shall introduce a nursing home insurance benefit 
     for contributors to hospital insurance organisations, and for 
     pensioners with medical service entitlement cards. There will 
     also be a new benefit for nursing aged people at home, in an 
     effort to reduce demand for nursing home treatment.
         In the coming weeks, I will be discussing with you 
     other features of the budget. But I'm sure you will agree 
     from what I have said today that for the family man, indeed 
     for the Australian community generally, the budget is most
     advantageous. Most important, it is responsible.
