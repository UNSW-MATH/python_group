                I do not think any Australian likes double standards. 



 There was an example of a double standard a short while ago. 



 The -rime Minister attacked General Motors Holden for having 



 appointed an American to be the Chief Executive Officer



 of that Company in Australia.                                                                  The view was very strongly 



put that an Australian ought to be chosen.




              In broad terms I would support that view.                                                                                          I was all



the more surprised, therefore, to find the Prime Minister 



announcing that a Canadian was being appointed to head the



Australian Department of Transport.                                                                             The person who has 


been appointed probably has many qualifications and many 



good ones, but if the Government wants to criticise the 



appointment of an imericanto head General Motors, how can 



it appoint a Canadian to head one of its own Departments.













              Earlier this month Jim Cairns, the Minister for Overseas



Trade, announced a 3-year agreement for the sale of wheat



to China.                           The agreement was for something between



4.0 to 4.7 million tons over 3 years - that is equivalent 



to a little over 170 million bushels over the 3 years.




              At present world prices that 170 million bushels would



be worth y 600 million.                                                   Unfortunately this agreement is 



not as firm as it sounds, because the price has only been 



negotiated for the first instalment, and whether or not a 



sale will in fact take place in the future will depend upon 



whether China and the Australian Wheat Board can agree on 



price.







                                                                                                                                                            •   •  0

          The first sales. have actually been negotiated, and are

   ro u_n.c_ 1 a 5Q• pe.rv 'bushel and are worth about ; 3O million.                                  Ta e
  Chinese expect world prices of wheat to fall, - becaúse the • 

  price for • the balance • of •the first year's commitment of 

  1.1 million- tons is • not to be negotiated until June • next
  year. •        The agreement is unfortunately a fairly loose one 
  and whether i_ é adv^ nta-,es wheat •growers or not tirill depend
• upon . t}a.e price actually to b: negotiated in the latter period
  of the agreement.                 ''`t this stage there is certainly no 

  firm coMmitment.





          Last week a Censure Notion was moved-against-the
  Government by Hr. Snedden,•Leader•• of the Opposition.                                         The 
  Prime Minister replied and then went off to 211bury to sign 
  an agreement with the •Victorian and New South hales r_emiers.

          This was no doubt an important occasion, but I asked the 

  Parliamentary Library to do a little research and on the 
  information given to me it was the first time a Prime Ni nister 
  had been absent from the Parliament muent while a Censure Notion 
  was still under debate, and the first time a Prime l in._i_ster 

  had left before the vote had been taken.

          These Censure Lotions are predictable in that the votes 

  are nearly always on Party lines, but they do provide an 
  opportunity for the Opposition to attack and to criticise 
  the Government and for the Government to defend its policies. 
  It is all part of the process of Parliament and Of public 
  education.

          I do not really believe the main charges of the

  Opposition were answered.                       Inflation is runningat nearly 
  15 percent and the Government has not yet done anything that
  will stop it.               `the Government has increased interest rates to 

  the highest level for 100 years, causing a good deal of 
  hardship and difficulty to many people especially to those
  trying, to save to buy their first horde.                               We all know last 

  year we were promised low interest rates - down to 3 percent - 
  what is your overdraft now, 8 percent, 9 percent or 10 percent

                                                                                                                3












                       The Government has of course put itself in this position 






  by refusing to use the instruments of economic control






  properly and adequately.                                                                                                It is seeking powers er: over 





  incomes and prices leading people to believe that this will 






  enable the Government to control inflation - it won't •unless 





  the fires that keep the pressures burnin.g are put out.





















                      Last -week the Minister for Labour said that he wanted •to 






  see Quarterly cost of adjustments to wage rates re-introduced.








                       I wonder if the Minister had read the judgement of the 





  Conciliation and arbitration Commission when they abandoned






  quarterly adjustments in 1952/53.                                                                                                                     Yhe Court pointed out






  •that it had stopped relating the basic wa "e merely to a basic 






  standard of •ne eds , as was the case in the Harvester _Lard. 





  The Court •said. that since 1950 the basic wage was based on 






  economic capacity to pay, which was quite a different concept





  leading to a higher wage.                                                                                            The wage was thus fixed at the 






  highest level that the Commission thought the economy could bear.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          rt





                       Because it was based. on the economic caacity to pay, the 





  Court said there was no justification for-maintaining quarterly






  adjustments,                                                   It • went on to say that the quarterly adjustments 





  had been an• accelerating factor in the rapid. increase in






.prices •and inflation, and the Court stron~.l~y rejected                                                                                                                                                                                 y

  opinions to the contrary that had been given to it.








                       The Court pointed out that the frequency and inpraeticability 






  of price• and wage changes makes the planr_ing of business or





  financial transactions very difficult .indeed.                                                                                                                                                         For example, 






  builders 'would be in a• difficult position giving a firm
