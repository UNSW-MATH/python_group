PRIME MINISTER'S
ELECTORATE TALK

8 NOVEMBER 1981

ON A VISIT TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA AT THE WEEKEND I WAS 
PRIVILEGED TO OPEN A NEW SWIMMING POOL FOR THE HANDICAPPED 
AT MINDA HOMES IN ADELAIDE,

THIS POOL WILL BOTH SERVE THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES AND PROVIDE 
AN AVENUE FOR RECREATION,

THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REHABILITATION OFFERED BY THE
MINDA SWIMMING POOL ARE AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONTRIBUTION BEING 
MADE THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA BY INDIVIDUALS, VOLUNTARY AGENCIES, 
ORGANISATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO ASSIST 
HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED AUSTRALIANS TO REALISE THEIR FULLEST 
POTENTIAL IN THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF DISABLED PERSONS,

THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLAYED A SUBSTANTIAL PART IN ENCOURAGING 
AND SUPPORTING THESE INITIATIVES

  - FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF
    CONCERN FOR THE WELL-BEING AND FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF 
    EVERY PERSON IN OUR SOCIETY.

COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR DISABLED AND 
HANDICAPPED PERSONS AMOUNTS TO $1.1 BILLION DOLLARS THIS 
FINANCIAL YEAR.

I AM WELL AWARE THAT THIS FIGURE COULD BE DOUBLED OR TREBLED 
WITHOUT THE REAL NEEDS THAT EXIST BEING FULLY MET,

                 2.
HOWEVER, THE 39 PER CENT REAL INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE THAT 
HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE 1975 LABOR BUDGET ILLUSTRATES 
THE REAL AND SYMPATHETIC COMMITMENT OF THIS GOVERNMENT TO 
THE WELL-BEING OF HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED PERSONS,

A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMMES ARE BEING FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT, 
INCLUDING INVALID PENSIONS, SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT ALLOWANCES, 
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN'S BENEFITS, SUBSIDIES TO NON-PROFIT 
ORGANISATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES WHICH PROVIDE 
FACILITIES FOR PHYSICALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY HANDICAPPED 
PEOPLE, AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND PUBLICATION 
OF BRAILLE AND AUDIO BOOKS FOR THE PRINT HANDICAPPED,

THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED PERSONS IS NOT JUST A 
'ONE-OFF' EXERCISE,

ITS IMPACT WILL BE OF MORE LASTING VALUE IN HELPING TO 
ACHIEVE GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE PRACTICAL RESPONSES 
TO THE NEEDS OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE

   - AND SO FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, OUR
     COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE OF DISABLED PERSONS WILL BE 
     A CONTINUING ONE.

THERE IS GROWING SUPPORT FOR LESS PATERNALISTIC OR PROTECTIVE 
SERVICES, SO THAT DISABLED PEOPLE WILL HAVE A GREATER MEASURE 
OF CONTROL OVER THEIR.OWN LIVES, AND MORE FREEDOM TO PURSUE 
THEIR OWN LIVES AND INTERESTS IN SURROUNDINGS AS NORMAL
AS POSSIBLE,

             3.

I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROGRESSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE VIEW 
WILL INCREASINGLY PREVAIL FROM NOW ON - AND WHILE FURTHER 
CONSOLIDATION WILL BE NEEDED, I SEE THIS AS A MAJOR 
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR DISABLED PERSONS,

THE GOVERNMENT SHARES THE VIEW WHICH IS GROWING IN THE 
COMMMUNITY THAT DISABLED PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO DEVELOP 
THEIR CAPACITIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT, THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
ENABLED WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE, TO LIVE BY 
THEMSELVES, OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES, AND TO USE COMMUNITY 
FACILITIES AS DO THE REST OF US,

TODAY, THERE IS A WIDESPREAD DESIRE TO SEE DISABLED PEOPLE 
BEING ENCOURAGED TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGES OF EVERYDAY LIVING 
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THEIR ABILITIES,

TO ENJOY A MEANINGFUL HOME LIFE AND PARTICIPATE IN ALL 
SOCIAL, CREATIVE OR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES IS A RIGHT 
TO WHICH ALL PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED,

I BELIEVE THAT WHEN A DISABLED PERSON IS PREPARED TO LIVE 
INDEPENDENTLY AND WANTS TO DO SO, THAT OUGHT TO BE 
ENCOURAGED,

THE COMMUNITY MUST BE PREPARED TO MEET EACH CASE ON AN 
INDIVIDUAL BASIS - FOR WITHOUT THIS RESPONSE, THE THEME 
OF IYDP - 'FULL PARTICIPATION AND EQUALITY' - WILL REMAIN 
UNFULFILLED,
