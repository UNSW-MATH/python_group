PRIME MINISTER'S
ELECTORATE TALK



SUNDAY, 25 APRIL 1982

THE MARCH QUARTER C,P,I, FIGURE PROVIDED GOOD NEWS ABOUT 
THE ECONOMY.
 - AT 1,7 PER CENT, IT IS CONSIDERABLY BELOW LAST 
   YEAR'S FIGURE

 - AND IS, IN FACT, THE LOWEST QUARTERLY INCREASE 
   SINCE 1979,

IT SHOWS SOME SLOWING DOWN IN THE UNDERLYING INFLATION 
RATE;
 - GIVES EVIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC 
   POLICIES ARE INDEED WORKING TO RESTRAIN PRICE 
   INCREASES,

 - AND CLEARLY INDICATES JUST HOW UNBALANCED
   RECENT REPORTS OF ECONOMIC GLOOM HAVE BEEN,

THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY GIVEN PRIORITY TO 
ATTACKING INFLATION,
 - FOR UNCONTROLLED INFLATION UNDERMINES 
   STABILITY, CONFIDENCE AND PROFITABILITY;

              2,


  - IT UNDERMINES THE INVESTMENT ON WHICH AUSTRALIA'S
    FUTURE DEPENDS

  - AND IT UNDERMINES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH IS 
    VITAL FOR INCREASED JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND RISING 
    PROSPERITY,

    THE LATEST INFLATION FIGURE IS GOOD NEWS

  -  BUT NOT A CAUSE FOR COMPLACENCY OR SLACKENING OFF,

THERE IS STILL REAL PRESSURE ON OUR LABOUR COSTS AND OUR 
PRICES

  - COMING FROM EXCESSIVE WAGE INCREASES AND SHORTER
    HOURS CAMPAIGNS,

THESE PRESSURES ADD TO THE SQUEEZE ON BUSINESS PROFITS

  - AND ARE THREATENING EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS AND 
    ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,

THE POINT IS CLEARLY BROUGHT HOME BY WHAT IS HAPPENING 
OVERSEAS

  - FOR THE INFLATION RATES OF OUR MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS 
    HAVE BEEN FALLING SIGNIFICANTLY AS THEIR DEPRESSED 
    ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE

          3.


     SOME
 - AND/EMPLOYEES IN SOME COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN OFFERING
   TO WORK HARDER FOR LESS PAY IN ORDER TO PROTECT 
   THEIR EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS AND TO HELP PROMOTE 
   ECONOMIC RECOVERY,


IT IS VITAL TO CONTAIN AUSTRALIA'S REAL LABOUR COSTS AND
OUR INFLATION RATE, FOLLOWING THE DOWNWARD TREND ESTABLISHED 
OVERSEAS


 - SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS,


AUSTRALIA HAS GREAT STRENGTHS,


 - WE HAVE A STRONG MANUFACTURING BASE,


 - EFFICIENT PRIMARY PRODUCERS,


 - ABUNDANT RESOURCES,


 - AND PEOPLE WITH THE ENERGY AND ABILITY TO KEEP 
   BUILDING AUSTRALIA UP, TO KEEP FINDING THE EXPORT 
   MARKETS WE NEED TO KEEP GROWTH GOING AND TO KEEP 
   INCREASING PROSPERITY,

               4.

AND CONTRARY TO THE ABSURD TALK OF RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE 
INVESTMENT UPSURGE FADING AWAY
  - NEW BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS CONTINUING AT A HIGH
    LEVEL.

WORLD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSE SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES FOR 
US IT IS TRUE.

  - BUT WE ARE STILL GROWING;

  - WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT WE CAN SUCCEED AGAINST
    WORLD TRENDS;

  - AND WE HAVE IN PLACE THE NEW PLANT, THE NEW FACTORIES, 
    THE MINES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP ON GROWING

    - AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE ANY RECOVERY IN WORLD TRADE.

 IF PEOPLE TAKE A REALISTIC AND A BALANCED VIEW OF OUR 
CIRCUMSTANCES,
  - IF PEOPLE TAILOR THEIR DEMANDS TO THOSE REALITIES,

  - AND IF WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE STABILITY AND 
    CERTAINTY IN POLICY THAT HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED 
    THE BASIS OF OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS,

  - THEN AUSTRALIA WILL KEEP BUILDING ON ITS STRENGTHS,
              oo000oo
