interest in two States should not have been allowed to overrule the
general good.
              In recent years it has become the fashion to decry
economists. As in all professions there are good and bad but our
present difficulties are clearly economic and if we are to come out 
of them successfully they must be correctly analysed and the correct
remedies applied.   Lets have a look at wages in relation to our
present position. First of all, no one wants or intends to freeze
wages.    The Commonwealth wants automatic adjustments to end and some 
 principles agreed upon which :Mate tribunals and Federal wage fixing 
 Courts would follow so that the dissatisfaction that now arises between 
 Federal and State awards would be uone away with. There is also a
 second and Vital reason.  laxperience 6f the past has shown that a 
 general rise of wages for a large body of employees cannot benefit 
 those employees by higher living standards, unless productivity
 or output per employee also rises. The cause is this — ea increased 
 wage to a great number of e:ployeea so increases costs that, the
 prices of the goods or services or commodities they produce,
  inevitably riseO and then the employees are no better off than thee-
 were before.   Only if productivity increases does an increased
  money wage bring an increased real wage in terms of things you can buy. 
           I think most people agree that wage increases are not 
  the primary cause of inflation but there is no doubt that wage increases 
  brought about automatically as a result of price rises, unmatched by
  increased productivity do make inflation worse.
                Over the last twelve months the Commonwealth has 
  introduced many measures to help get our overseas trade balances in 
  order. These measures will be made completely ineffective, if a 
  wage price spiral in this country further increases the cost of
  goods we are trying to export.
                As a Liberal, I don't like any kind of wage or
  price control and usually,' believe, we should be able to manage our 
   economy sueeessful. ,y without these things but to time of emergency 
   they can become aeceesary end if we are to have one, logically we should
   have the other.  As I understand it that is why the Commonwealth

offered selective price control to the tAetes 1A
cessation of quarterly cost ni' living adjustments~ ~hici 
mean that sues are frown, but which does mean that automatic 
adjustment would end and that to get a new 'race proper application 
would have to be made to the relevant tribunal or court.
         Ur. (lair has suggested anew rsonfez.~eace. lr Arthur 
Padden has supported it. Another rztt.evt must be made to solve 
these problems. Too much is at stake to let local difficulties

The recent conference was neither the time nor the place fbr 
these local difficulties which should have been and were 
raised at t.e annual Premiers' conference which decides the
allocation of loan funds and of tax    iOurselpemts to t#e
States.  As a result of dix, Rylah's (Deputy Premier) actiom 
at the Loan conference Victoria received an extra £1T . fro.
