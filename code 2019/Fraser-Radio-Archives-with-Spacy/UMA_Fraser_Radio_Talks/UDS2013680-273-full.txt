        WEEKLY PRESS STATEMENT
        MALCOLM FRASER              22 August 1967


                    .POINTS FROM THE BUDGET


            Last week the Treasurer introduced his second Budget. Total 
        Budget expenditure will be just under $6,500 million. Total revenues are
        estimated to be 85,887 million and this will leave about $596 million to 
        be financed from borrowings, which is 861 million more than the amount 
        borrowed last year.
            Notwithstanding these large sums, Commonwealth expenditure has been 
        restrained to a certain extent this year. The rate of increase over the 
        previous year was 92% against a rate of increase_ of 11% the year before. 
        There will also be a consiserable improvement in the annual increase in 
        revenue, which this year is estimated to be $499 million, whereas last 
        year's increase was only $306 million.
            Turning new to individual items of expenditure within the Budget; 
        the amount spent on Defence has risen by 18% this year over last year's 
        figure. Over the last four years there has been an increase of $700 million 
        in the Defence Bill and-this tremendous increase has been accomplished with 
        relatively little change in the normal rate of economic growth. However, 
        the Treasurer has pointed out that Australia will not be able to continue to 
        afford such rate of growth in Defence spending. One aspect of this item 
        which is of particular concern to the Government is the amount spent under 
        this heading overseas. The overseas expenditure of Defence five years ago 
        was less than $100 million a year but this year it may be over $350 million 
        which would represent about 11% of our export earnings. For this reason 
        Defence Services have a policy of buying in Australia were possible and I am 
        pleased to be"able to say that the Army spends about 80% of its capital 
        equipment vote in Australian factories.
            International aid is another large and growing field of Government 
        expenditure overseas. This year our aid will total 0.75% of our estimated 
        national income and only France makes a higher aid contribution than that. 
        It .should also be remembered that unlike all other aid—giving countries we 
        provide our official aid in grants with no strings attached whilst most 
        other countries give their aid in the form of loans or grants which must 
        be spent in the country of Origin.
            In the field of national welfare payments, such as Social Services, 
        Health and Repatriation, expenditure will rise by more than $50 million to 
        a total of $1,332 million,. This exceeds all the pay-as—you—earn income tax 
        collections of the last financial year. Such sums can, however, only be 
        raised by the imposition of income tax on the individual and it is important 
        to remember that payments from the Commonwealth represent money which has 
        been collected from every one of us and paid out by the Commonwealth in the 
        interests of the nation.

                2.



    This year there will be increased payments for child endowment, 
representing a progressive increase of 25¢ for the fourth and each
subsequent child in a family. This means that a family of, say, 9 children 
will get an additional $5.25 per week. It is on families of this size that 
financial burdens fall most heavily and, recognising this, the Government 
has sought to alleviate their hardship.
    Pensioners with defective hearing will also be able to borrow 
hearing aids at a nominal charge from the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories. 
    Individual Items of Expenditure 
    $1,071 million — Age, invalid and widows' pensions, medical, 
hospital and general health benefits and home savings grants.
    $261 million — Repatriation. Further increase of $11 million, which 
includes some additional payments to war orphans.
