PRESS STATEMENT

THE HON. MALCOLM FRASER, M.P.




COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE IN THE PROVISION OF SCIENCE FACILITIES 
IN VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT SECONDARY SCHOOLS




    Malcolm Fraser, Minister for Education and Science and
Federal Member for Wannon, announced today that he had authorised 
final payment to Victoria of the unmatched grants available for 
the provision of science teaching facilities in government schools 
under the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Act 1965-1967. The 
total amount paid to the state of Victoria for government schools 
since the scheme commenced in 1964 is $8,180,800. During the same 
period Victorian independent schools are receiving grants totalling 
$3,393,000.
    At 100 Victorian government schools science laboratories
have been or are being built with Commonwealth funds or a combination 
of Commonwealth and State funds. The estimated Commonwealth grants 
for these buildings is $6 million. In addition, the State had 
used, up to 30 December 1967, some $2 million of the Commonwealth 
grants for the purchase of science teaching apparatus additional 
to that provided with State funds. As a result of the distribution 
of this apparatus by the State Education Department, every Victorian 
Government school which teaches secondary science has received some 
additional apparatus as a result of the Commonwealth grants.
    The 100 Victorian government schools, as selected by the
State, at which laboratories have been or are being built under the 
science facilities scheme are listed in the attachment to this state- 
ment. The Minister stated that in relation to independent schools he 
would make available shortly a list giving details of all schools 
selected by the State Advisory Committees for assistance within the 
scheme together with the amount of grants to particular schools in 
each of the four years to 30 June, 1968.
     The Government has already announced its intention of proposing 
to Parliament that the program be continued for a further three years 
from 1 July 1968. During that extension, Government secondary schools 
in Victoria will receive $6,123,000 and Victorian independent secondary
schools will receive $4,514,100.
