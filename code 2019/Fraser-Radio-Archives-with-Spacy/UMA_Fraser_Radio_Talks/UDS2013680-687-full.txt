       ELECTORAL TALK

     THE GOVERNMENT'S 1975 BUDGET

IN THIS THIRD LABOR BUDGET, THE FIRST BY THEIR THIRD 
TREASURER, MR HAYDEN RECOGNISES THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO-BEGIN RECREATING EMPLOYMENT.

HOWEVER HE REFUSES TO TAKE THE ACTION WHICH WILL GET THAT 
PROCESS GOING. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE HAYDEN BUDGET 
IS A FAILURE.

UNEMPLOYMENT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE REDUCED BY THIS BUDGET AS 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS, 
MR. HAWKE, QUICKLY RECOGNISED.

WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE BUDGET BEING PRESENTED, MR. HAWKE 
WAS WARNING OF THESE DANGERS AND WARNING THE GOVERNMENT 
ALSO THAT IF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT OF -WORK GETS WORSE; 
THEY WILL HAVE TO BRING DOWN ,A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET. THE 
SAME WARNING HAS COME FROM THE ERSTWHILE TREASURER DR CAIRNS 
IN HIS FIRST COMMENT ON THE BUDGET.

THE BUDGET MAKES A GESTURE TOWARDS PRIVATE COMPANIES WITH A, 
REDUCTION OF 20 IN COMPANY TAX, BUT THE ADDITIONAL COST 
BURDEN IMPOSED ON COMPANIES THROUGH HIGHER PETROL PRICES 
NULLIFIES THIS.

WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR NEEDS IS CONTROL OVER INFLATION AND 
A DIVERSION OF RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND 
BACK INTO PRODUCTIVITY. YET THE STARTING POINT FOR THE 
BUDGET IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT INFLATION WILL CONTINUE AT 
10 P.A. AND THAT WAGES WILL RISE BY 22`p.

                      2



IT REINS BACK THE RATE OF INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, 

BUT THERE WILL STILL BE A REAL INCREASE IN THE RESOURCES 

TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.



IF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT CONTINUES TO FALL, GOVERNMENT 

SPENDING WILL TAKE A BIGGER AND BIGGER SLICE.



THE TREASURY FORECASTS A RISE IN EMPLOYMENT BY 1 PER CENT 

DURING THE COMING YEAR.



BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE FOR THE FIRST TIME 

AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT AT TIIIS LEVEL ONLY POINTS TO A 

CONSIDERABLE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT PARTICULARLY IN EARLY 1976.



MR. HAWKE' S ESTIMATE THAT THERE WOULD BE 500 000,0R 8 PER CENT
                         S Al Cho Li itAk.
OF THE WORKFORCE UNEMPLOYED   r'       TO BECOME A

REALITY.



THHIS THEN IS THE ESSENTIAL FAULT IN THE BUDGET. MR. HAYDEN 

RECOGNISED THE NEED TO CUT GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN ORDER 

TO RELEASE RESOURCES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.



HE RECOGNISED THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN 

ORDER TO GET INVESTMENT GOING AND EhPLOYMENT RISING.



THAT HE SHOULD WIN THE PRAISE FROM COMMENTATORS MERELY FOR 

IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM iHILE STILL.. FAILING TO TAKE STEPS TO 

REMEDY IT, IS A PARADOX EASILY EXPLAINED BY THE LOW ESTE-1 

IN WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOW HELD'; AND THE LOW EXPECTATIONS 

PEOPLE HAVE OF IT

            3

FAINT FRAISE DOES NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT AS A GENERAL 
ECONOMIC DOCUMENT AND AS A FISCAL INSTRUMENT FOR THE REVIVAL 
OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY THE BUDGET Is A FAILURE.

IT WILL NOT REVIVE INVESTMENT, RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND CREATE 
JOBS. IT WILL NOT REDUCE INFLATION.

MR. HAYDEN'S BUDGET ALSO SETS OUR TO REFORM TAXATION BUT HERE 
THE BUDGET IS NOT A FAILURE AS MUCH AS A HOAX.

THE BUDGET IURI'ORTS TO SAVE TAXPAYERS 200 MILLION DOLLARS 
A YEAR. IT IS A CHEAP GESTURE WHEN AT THE OUTSET THIS LOSS 
TO THE REVENUE IS COVERED BY HIGHER EXCISE ON BEER, PETROL 
AND CIGARETTES. IT IS SEEN AS AN EVEN MORE DERISORY GESTURE 
WHEN THE INCREASED TAX RIF OFF FROM THE PROGRESSIVE SCALES IS 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. IF WAGES GO UP BY NO MORE THAN THE 22 
PER CENT FORECAST IN THE BUDGET, THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FHUM 
}AY AS YOU EARN TAX TOTALS 2600 MILLION DOLLARS.

THAT IS MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS THE SO CALLED SAVINGS 
AND MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS THE FORECAST RISE IN WAGES.

WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TIIE EFFECT OF THE PROGRESSIVE TAX 
SCALE, THE MAN ON AVERAGE EARNINGS WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT OF 
THESE REFORMS WHICH AMOUNT TO A DISGUISED WAY OF ABOLISHING 
CONCESSIONAL DEDUCTIONS.

UNDER THE NEW REBATE SYSTEM A SINGLE PERSON ON AVERAGE WEEKLY 
EARNINGS WILL RAY OUT 20 FER CENT OF HIS INCOME IN TAX INSTEAD 
OF 21.3 FER CENT.

           4
  9't4 V4 - * t444,41MV
A MAN tc1TH A WIFE AND TDO CHILDREN BUT NO OTHER CONCEsS1ONAL 
DEDUCTIONS WILL HAY OUT 14.7 PER CENT DURING THE COMING YEAR 
INSTEAD OF 10.7 PER CENT OF HIS INCOME.

1P ?H Cr430At Paskwv H,q.S 4
A              1 ,000 DOLLARS' WORTH OF
OTHER CONCESSIONAL DEDUCTIONS DILL PAY OUT 14.7 PER CENT OF EIS 
EARNINGS IN TAX UNDER THE NEW SCALE INSTEAD OF 11.9 PER CENT 
UNDER THE OLD.


BECAUSE OF THE CHANGED NATURE OF TAX COLLECTION, HIS TAKE
HOME PAY WILL RISE WifILE HIS END OF YEAR REFUND WILL FALL.
HE WILL THINK HE IS GETTING MORE WHILE HE IS ACTUALLY GETTING 
LESS. HE DILL HAVE BEEN TRICKED IF HE BELIEVES HE IS BETTER OFF.


THAT IN FACT IS WHAT Miì. HAYDEN'S BUDGET IS ALL ABOUT - 
TRICKERY AND DECEIT.


HIS BUDGET IS NOT AN ECONOMIC DOCUMENT BUT A POLITICAL DOCUMENT( 
DESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SCRABBLES IN THE 
MESS OF ITS OWN MAKING.


THERE IS ANOTHER INSIDIOUS ASPECT TO THIS DOCUMET1'AND THAT IS 
ITS EFFECT ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THROUGH THE INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH IT CLAIMS TO BE AIDING. 
BY ITS ABOLITION OF ITS INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR LOW AND MIDDLE 
INCOME EARNERS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A MAJOR. STEP TOWARDS 
RENDERING SAVINGS THROUGH LIFE INSURANCE UNATTRACTIVE.


THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO CREATE A SITUATION IN WHICH PEOPLE 
LOOK TO IT FOR SECURITY INSTEAD OF TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR OM 
EFFORTS.

                        5
ON THE FACTS , THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO SET OUT IN THIS
BUDGET TO CONTINUE THE DESTRUCTION BY STAGES OF THE INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY, AN INDUSTRY WHICH RANKS SECOND TO THE BANKING
SYSTEM AS A SOURCE OF INVESTMENT .

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS THE MEANS BY WHICH THE SAVINGS OF 
INDIVIDUALS ARE MARSHALLED AND CHANNELLED INTO INDUSTRY AND 
COMMERCE.

IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 10 PER CENT OF PRIVATE CAPIT. L I NvES-TTEtVÌ 
IN AUSTRALIA , AND THE GOVEENMENT APPEARS TO BE OUT 1c, C3R-c*Wt
THIS INDUSTRY TO ITS KNEES. THIS IS SOCIALISM BI .' 
IT IS; CONSISTENT WITH THE PHILOSOPHICAL ATTITUDES OF MANS ikf 
THE LABOR PARTY AND IT IS BEING PERPETRATED IN SECRECY.






















                                                      ~..... :~".
