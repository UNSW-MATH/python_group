THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLETELY FAILED TO JUSTIFY ITS DECISION TO 


ESTABLISH AN AGIO. THERE IS EVERY JUSTIFICATION FOR A NATIONAL 


DISASTER FUND BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCEPT FROM THE 


IDEA THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD COMPETE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE 


COMPANIES. IT WILL BE AN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE FOR AUSTRALIAN 


TAXPAYERS TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE WHICH X WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 


PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH ANY LOWER PREMIUMS OR ANY BETTER SERVICE 


IF IT IS TO COMPETE FAIRLY WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY. THIS XX HAS 


BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE VARIOUS STATE GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICES 


WHICH GENERALLY RUN AT A HEAVY LOSS AND WHICH CANNOT OFFER BETTER 


TERMS TO REM PRIVATE INSURANCE HOLDERS THAN PRIVATE COMPANIES. 


THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE AGIO COMPETES FAIRLY 


WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE BILL, HOWEVER, CONTAINS 


MANY EXAMPLES OF SUBSTANTIAL ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE CONFERRED 


UPON THE AGIO AND WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE 


COMPANAIES WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE


AGIO.






IN THIS SHORT TALK, I MUST LIST SOME OF THESE A EXAMPLES BRIEFLY.






(1) THE BILL DOES NOT 1AKE TEE AGIO SUBJECT TO THE TRADE PRACTICES 


ACT (WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO). THE AGIO 


COULD, THEREFORE, ENGAGE IN EXCLUSIVE AGENCY AREAS (PERHAPS WITH 


THE POST OFFICE OF THE COMMONWEALTH BANK) WITHOUT BEING ANSWERABLE 


TO THE TRADE PRACTICES TRIBUNAL IN THE WAY'IN WHICH INSURANCE 


COMPANIES WOULD BE ANSWERABLE. SIMILARLY, IT IS EXEMPT FROM THE PRO?

                                         FOLLOWING
VISIONS WHICH RELATE TO MONOPOLISATION ( (FrialaNN ITS

POWER TO ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES), CONSUMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND 


RESTRICTIONS UPON ADVERTISING. THE MANAGERS OF THE AGIO'S

                2.

INVESTMENT FUND WOULD ALSO APPEAR TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE CONTROLS 
MFMNmRRM IMPOSED OVER PRIVATE FUND MANAGERS IN THE CORPORATIONS 
AND SECURITIES INDUSTRY BILL.

(2) SIMILARLY, THE AGIO IS EXEMPT FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE 
COMPANIES ACT - A COSTLY AND EXPENSIVE OBLIGATION OF PRIVATE
INDUSTRY.
(3) IT IS ALSO EXPRESSLY EXEMPT FROM THE OPERATION OF THE
INSURANCE ACTS WHICH LAY DOWN THE TERMS UNDER WHICH INSURANCE 
COMPANIES MUST OPERATE. WITH INFLATION AND COMPETITION WITHIN 
THE INSURANCE INXNTX INDUSTRY, A NUMBER OF !14X THESE COMPANIES WILL 
FIND IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED 
BY THE INSURANCE ACTS AND BEING IN THAT ALIEN CONDITION IT WOULD 
BE DIFFICULT FOR OTHER COMPANIES TO TAKE THEM OVER WITHOUT THEMSELVES 
BEING IN BREACH OF THE INSURANCE ACTS. THE AGIO COULD, THEREFORE, 
TAKE OVER SUCH COMPANIES CHEAPLY AND YET BE EXEMPT FROM THE
MONOPOLY PROVISIONS OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT.
(4) TTHE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE BOARD OF THE AGIO MAY DEEM 
CERTAIN THINGS TO BE IN THE NATIONAL INTERESTS MERELY BECAUSE 
THE AGIO CANNOT UNDERTAKE CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE ACCORDING 
TO ORDINARY COMMERCIAL PRINCIPLES. IF COMPETITION WERE TO BE 
STRICTLY FAIR, IT SHOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO CLASSIFY A CERTAIN 
CLASS OF INSURANCE AS BEING IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST IF NO 
INSURANCE COMPANY COULD HANDLE W SUCH INSURANCE ACCORDING TO
ORDINARY COMMERCIAL PRINCIPLES.
(5) THE BILL GIVES A CAPITAL GRANT OF $800,000, interest FREE, 
A LUXURY WHICH NO PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS, AND ALSO PROVIDES

 that the treasury may make further advances without being 
 OBLIGED TO CHARGE COMMERCIAL RATES OF INTEREST AND IMPOSE OTHER 
 TERMS WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSED BY THE MARKET PLACE UPON INSURANCE
 COMAPNIES.
 (6) THE GOVERNMENT CONTEMPLATES THAT THE AGIO WILL TAKE OVER THE 
 HOUSING LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION FOR A MINIMAL FIGURE OF $200,000 
 WITH ITS RESERVE OF OVER $7,000,000.

THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE BEING 
CONFERRED UPON THE AGIO. THE GOVERNMENT IS, THEREFORE, BEING 
QUITE DECEITFUL IN SAYING THAT THE AGIO WILL COMPETE FAIRLY WITH 
PRIVATE INDUSTRY, IT IS NO WONDER THAT EMPLOYEES OF THE INSURANCE 
INDUSTRY ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS 
AIMED AT NATIONALISING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND PLACING THE HUGE 
PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT OF PRIVATE INDUSTRY UNDER THE CONTROL
OF THE GOVERNMENT.
THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS BILL; IT WOULD BE A HUGE BURDEN 
FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYER AND WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE AT A 
PROFIT AND WILL BE ABLE TO CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO X BAIL IT OUT 
WHENEVER IT MAKES A LOSS - AND IF THE EXAMPLE OF OTHER GOVERNMENT 
ENTERPRISES IS ANY GUIDE, IT WILL MAKE A HEAVY LOSS ALL THE TIME.
THE OPPOSITION IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING THE BILL AND ITS POSSIBLE 
RAMIFICATIONS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE BILL CAN BE AMENDED IN ORDER TO 
MAKE THE AGIO COMPETE ON A FAIRER BASIS OR WHETHER THE BILL SHOULD 
BE REJECTED ENTIRELY, BUT WITH SOME ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT BEING MADE TC 
ESTABLISHMENT A NATIONAL DISASTER FUND.
(As Mr. Fraser knows precisely what he wants to say about the options 
mp open to him, I have not dealt with this at length)
