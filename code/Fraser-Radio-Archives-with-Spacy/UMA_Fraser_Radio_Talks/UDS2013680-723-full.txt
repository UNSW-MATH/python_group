ELECTORATE TALK FOR 
22 NOVEMBER 1981

AUSTRALIA IS A SPARSE, DRY CONTINENT

   - AND THE AVAILABILITY OF GOOD WATER SUPPLIES HAS
     ALWAYS BEEN CRITICAL TO AIR DEVELOPMENT.

THE GREAT WATER PROJECTS OF EARLIER YEARS HAVE BEEN LANDMARKS 
IN OUR ECONOMIC PROGRESS AS A NATION.

PROJECTS SUCH AS THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME HAVE MEANT AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO AUSTRALIA

   - AND IT IS PLAIN THAT DEMANDS ON OUR LIMITED WATER
     RESOURCES WILL INCREASE IN THE YEARS AHEAD,

THE GOVERNMENT RECENTLY TOOK THE HISTORIC DECISION THAT WE MUST 
DEVELOP A PERSPECTIVE ON AUSTRALIA'S TOTAL WATER RESOURCE NEEDS 
RIGHT THROUGH TO THE YEAR 2000.

SUCH A PERSPECTIVE WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN DEVELOPING A STRATEGY 
TO MEET AUSTRALIA'S WATER REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE 1980'S 
AND 1990'S.

TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY PERSPECTIVE, AN INVESTIGATION AND 
STUDY WILL BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY, IN COLLABORATION WITH RELEVANT WATER 
AUTHORITIES AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS,

            2.

THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES WE NEED AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF ALL 
AUSTRALIAN WATER RESOURCES

  - INCLUDING UNDERGROUND AS WELL AS SURFACE WATER

  - IN TERMS OF BOTH QUALITY AND QUANTITY.

            3,

WE NEED ESTIMATES OF CURRENT WATER USAGE

  - WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRENDS IN EXPENDITURES
    ON WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

  - AND WE NEED TO EXAMINE THE IMPLICATIONS OF FUTURE 
    DEMANDS,
THE INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON WATER MANAGEMENT ISSUES OF 
NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE

  - IT WILL CONSIDER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO DEAL 
    WITH FUTURE REQUIRE`'ENTS

  - AND IT WILL SET OUT OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES 
  AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE REVEALED BY THE INVESTIGATION,

FUNDS OF $250,000 WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO GET THE INVESTIGATION 
UNDERWAY THIS FINANCIAL YEAR

  - AND THE BENEFITS FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL OBVIOUSLY 
    BE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THESE COSTS,

THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT WILL BE CONTACTING THE STATES 
SHORTLY TO OUTLINE THE CONCEPT, AND TO SEEK THEIR CO-OPERATION,

             4,
GOOD WATER SUPPLIES ARE OF BASIC IMPORTANCE TO ALL AUSTRALIANS

  - TO EVERY AUSTRALIAN FAMILY, TO EVERY AUSTRALIAN
    BUSINESS, TO VIRTUALLY EVERY ACTIVITY WHICH TAKES 
    PLACE IN AUSTRALIA,

AND THE DECISION BY THE GOVENRMENT TO INITIATE THIS INVESTIGATION

  - WHICH IS OBVISOULY AN INDISPENSIBLE PRELIMINARY
    TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY

  - IS A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
    DETERMINATION THAT WATER RESOURCE PROBLEMS 
    SHALL NOT CONSTRAIN AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT,

AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE 
AVAILABLE TO IT INFORMATION WHICH WILL GIVE US GUIDANCE 
IN WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT THROUGH TO THE END OF 
THIS CENTURY

  - SO THAT WE CAN USE OUR MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING
    SKILLS TO PREVENT INADEQUACIES IN WATER SUPPLIES
    FROM IMPOSING AVOIDABLE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT 
    OF AUSTRALIA,

THIS INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT 
IN RELATION TO WATER RESOURCES IS OBVIOUSLY VERY MUCH IN 
HARMONY WITH THE NEW RIVER MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT WHICH 
WAS ENTERED INTO BY THE THREE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE 
COMMONWEALTH A FEW WEEKS AGO

             5.
  - WHICH WILL RESULT IN EFFECTIVE AND CO-OPERATIVE
    MANAGEMENT OF THE MURRAY, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO 
    THE SALINITY PROBLEMS,

AUSTRALIA'S WATER RESOURCES ARE BEING EXAMINED FROM A NUMBER 
OF VIEWPOINTS.

THE AUSTRALIAN WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL - A COMMONWEALTH/STATE 
FORUM FOR CO-OPERATION TO MUTUAL ADVANTAGE - IS NOW NEARING THE 
COMPLETION OF A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW OF WATER RESEARCH IN 
AUSTRALIA.

C.S,I,R,O, HAS RECENTLY COMPLETED AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF ITS WATER 
RESEARCH PROGRAMS, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING A MORE 
EFFECTIVE AND VISIBLE FOCUS FOR ITS WATER RESEARCH EFFORT,

WE MUST HAVE AN ADEQUATE RESEARCH BASE TO SUPPORT WHATEVER 
INITIATIVES ARE NECESSARY TO OVERCOME WATER RESOURCE 
DIFFICULTIES,

THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE 1970'S THERE WAS QUITE RIGHTLY A 
PARTICULAR FOCUS IN OUR NATIONAL PLANNING ON OUR MINERAL AND 
ENERGY RESOURCES

  - AND UP TO THIS POINT IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO MEET THE
    WATER REQUIREMENTS OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AT MANAGEABLE 
    LEVELS EVEN IN ARID AREAS.

r                  6,
•


      BUT IT IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN WHETHER WE CAN CONTINUE 

      TO ASSUME THE CONTINUED,AVAILABILITY OF WATER WITHIN THE 
      RANGE OF COSTS WHICH HAS PREVAILED UNTIL NOW,



      THERE ARE ALREADY INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLE CONFLICTS IN 
      THE USE OF AVAILABLE WATER RESOURCES



        - AND IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO WORK OUR WAY

          THROUGH TO EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS,


      WHILE THE STATES ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 

      AND MANAGEMENT OF WATER SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES, THE COMMONWEALTH 

      HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION THROUGH THE NATIONAL WATER 
      RESOURCES PROGRAM,



      AND ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF 

      OUR OVERALL BUDGETARY RESTRAINT



        - OVER $220 MILLION WILL HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE END OF

          THIS FINANCIAL YEAR BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES 
          TOGETHER, SINCE 1978/79



        - AND $110 MILLION OF THIS IS COMMONWEALTH FUNDS,



      THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA OF 

      FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN TO ALL AUSTRALIANS



        - AND THE PERSPECTIVE TO BE DEVELOPED ON WATER RESOURCE

          NEEDS TO THE YEAR 2000 IS A FURTHER FORWARD LOOKING
          INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT ON AN ISSUE
          THAT IS VITAL TO o'!STRALIA'S FUTURE,
