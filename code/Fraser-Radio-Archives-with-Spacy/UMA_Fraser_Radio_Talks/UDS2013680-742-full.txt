IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS, THE LABOR PARTY HAS SHOWN PLAILY THAT 
IT LACKS THE 'TABILI TY WHICH AUSTRALIA WANTS

   - AND THE POLICIES WHICH AUSTRALIA NEEDS.

OUR JOB IS TO FACE SQUARELY THE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES THE 
WORLD IS EXPERIENCING

     f'~WHICH ARE NOW HITTING AUSTRALIA HARD.

THE GOVER'1ENT'S POLICIES ARE RIGHT FOR AUSTLIA'S 
CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE AUSTRALIAN CO"1MU-wITY M:TS THE GOVERNMENT TO TACKLE 
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS REALISTICALLY.

OUR POLICIES HAVE HELPED CUSHION THE IMPACT OF THE WORLD 
ECONO`1IC DOWNTURN ON AUSTRALIA.

WHAT AUSTRALIA NEEDS ABOVE ALL IS A WILLINGrESS TO WORK 
T66ETHER AT ALL LEVELS

   - E8R IT ig BY W0RkIF6 T86ÄTHER, BY MAKIN6 tit HEST
     OF CUR ADVANTAGES, AND BY ENCOURAGING THE INITIATIVE
     OF AUSTRALIANS, THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR ECONO-1IC GOALS.

              2.


THE POLICIES 'r-HICH LABOR HAS ADOPTED WOULD TAKE AUSTRALIA 
DOK THE " "NG ROAD ENTIRELY.

AT A TIME OF REAL DIFFICULTY FOR THE MINING INDUSTRY

  - THE LABOR PARTY WOULD INFLICT A RESOURCES TAX.

SURELY WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE I-DIVESTMENT IN THE MINING INDUSTRY

  - SO THAT AUSTRALIA WILL DE IN A POSITION TO TAKE 
    ADVUTAGE OF ANY UPTURN I THE WORD ECONOMY.

LABOR'S EXTRA RESOURCE TAX CAN ONLY DISCOURAGE MINING INVESTr`1E `‡T

  - ESPECIALLY WHEN MINERS GENERALLY ARE NOT MAKING 
    SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS.

 IT IS NAIVE TO THINK THE NEW TAX RESOURCE WOULD REPLACE 
STATE TAXES

  - IT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL

  - BECAUSE THE STATE PREMIERS WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO 
    GIVE UP THEIR TAXES TO THE COMMONWEALTH.

 OR TAKE LABOR'S URANIUM POLICY.

 THEY WANT TO SHUT THE INDUSTRY DUSTRY DO' N .

             3.


IT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY LIKE AUSTRALIA, 
RICH IN NAT1 RESOURCES

  - WITH NO FORESEEABLE NEED FOR NUCLEAR POWER

  - TO TALK ABOUT LEAVING URANIUM IN THE GROUND.

BUT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHICH NEED THE URANIUM WHICH WE CM 
SUPPLY TO MEET THEIR ENERGY REOUIREMENTS.

LABOR'S AMENDED POLICY NOWHERE SAYS THAT EXISTING CONTRACTS 
WILL BE WORKED OUT

  - MR HAYDEN HAS SAID THAT ANY SUGGESTION THAT LABOR
    HAS ABANDONED ITS OPPOSITION TO URANIUM IS A "TRAVESTY 
    OF THE FACTS".

 IN SEEKING TO CLOSE DOWN THE URANIUM INDUSTRY, LABOR POLICY 
 IGNORES OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO OTHERS

  - AND DENIES JOBS TO AUSTRALIANS AND EXPORT INCOME
    TO AUSTRALIA.

 TAKE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES.

 LABOR WANTS TO STRENGTHEN AN EXISTING SECTION OF THE ICOlE 
 AMENDMENT ACT TO MAKE IT WORK AS AN "EFFECTIVE TAX ON REALIZED 
 CAPITAL GAINS AND PROFITS"

            14.



  - BUT !'~E ARE NOT TOLD WHAT THE CHANGES WOULD BE.

SENATOR EVANS HAS SAID HE HAS A SECRET DRAFT OF AA REWATTE' 
SECTION 26A WHICH WILL DO THE JOB WHICH WE WANT TO DO"
  - AND WE ARE ENTITLED TO BELIEVE IT WILL DE A 
    CAPITAL GAINS TAX BY STEALTH.

AT A TIME WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK THE BURDEN OF PERSONAL 
INCOME TAX IS TOO HIGH, LABOR IS ALSO CO.`IMITTED TO REDUCING 
THE INCIDEtCE OF INDIRECT TAXES

  - WHICH COULD ONLY MEAN HIGHER INCOME TA ES UNDER LABOR.

DY FAVOURING INCREASED PROGRESSIVITY OF THE PRRSONAL Ii COME 
TAX SUPPLY

  - LABOR WANTS TO PUSH THE HIGHER TAX RATES STILL 
    HIGHER, 

THAT WOULD REDUCE IACE∞-TIVE,

  - IT WOULD REDUCE PRODUCTIVITY 

  - 
    AVOIDANCE.

                  ~
                  ~.







THE LABOR PARTY HAS DECLARED ITS SOCIALIST COMMITMENT TO 

REDISTRTRPTING INCOME IN AUSTRALIA BUT ITS FACTIONS DISAGEEE 

PROFOUNDLY ON THE MEANS.




PROBATE TAX IS ONE MEA S FAVOURED BY MR CAIN LI VICTORIA.




MR CAIN WAS PROCLAIMING THE VIRTUES OF PROBATE FOR VICTORIA 

                                         AT THE TIÔE WHEN MR WRAN WAS BOASTING OF ABOLISHING IT I 

N.S.W.




MR CAIN'S PROBATE TAX - AT 39 CENTS I.: 1-7. DOLLAR - WILL BE 

A CRUEL EXPROPRIATION FROM HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD

WORKED HARD TO SECURE THEIR OWN, AND THEIR CHILRBE'S FUTURE.




THE LIMIT 00 $200,000 IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PROTECT OTECT MANY 

ORDINARY PEOPLE WITH NORMAL, SUBURBAN HOMES, PEOPLE WITH 

SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THOSE WITH A HOME AND SUPERANNUATION.





PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START A BUSINESS WILL LEAVE VICTORIA.




THE VALUE OF HOUSES WILL FALL.




THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE EMPTY HOUSES AS PEOPLE WHO ARE 

RETIRING LEAVE FOR OTHER STATES.




THERE WILL BE LESS WORK IN THE BUILDING I E` DUSTRY .




THERE WILL BE FEWER JOBS.

             6.

MR CAIN'S PROBATE WILL DAMAGE VICTORIA'S ECONOMY BY TURANG 
AWAY INVESTMENT, AND CAUSE AN EXODUS OF VICTORIANS.

THE SUBSTANCE OF LABOR'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE WAS SUMMED UP 
IN THE ATTITUDES ON WAGE INDEXATION.

THE CONFERENCE FIRSTLY VOTED TO REJECT A PROPOSAL FOR FULL 
QUARTERLY WAGE INDEXATION IN ITS ECONOMIC PLATFORM.

BY ITSELF, THAT WOULD SEEM LIKE A REJECTION OF A DANGEROUSLY 
INFLATIONARY WAGE POLICY.

EUT THEN TWO DAYS LATER, IN ITS INDUSTRIAL RELATWOS 
PLATFORM THE CONFERENCE MADE A COMMITMENT TO WORK TOWARDS 
AUTOMATIC FULL OUARTERLY INDEXATIM.

I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN LABOR SPOKESMEN TALK TO BUSINESS 
GROUPS THEY GIVE THEM THE FIRST VERSION
  - AND WHEN SPEAKING TO TRADE UNIONS THEY USE THE
    SECONN VERSION.
