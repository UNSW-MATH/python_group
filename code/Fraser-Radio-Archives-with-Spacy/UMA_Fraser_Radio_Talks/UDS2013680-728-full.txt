PRIME MINISTERS ELECTORATE TALK
"A BALANCED DEFENCE FORCE FOR AUSTRALIA"
SUNDAY, 28 FEBRUARY 1982

LAST THURSDAY, DEFENCE MINISTER JIM KILLEN ANNOUNCED 
THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ACQUIRE H.M.S. INVINCIBLE 
FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM,

THIS FOLLOWS HIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST OCTOBER THAT 
AUSTRALIA WOULD ACQUIRE 75 FADS AIRCRAFT FROM THE 
UNITED STATES AS OUR NEW TACTICAL FIGHTER FORCE.

THESE ARE TWO OF THE MOST RECENT DECISIONS IN 
ACHIEVING THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME TO DEVELOP OUR 
DEFENCE FORCE AND TO ENHANCE OUR OVERALL DEFENCE 
CAPABILITIES,

THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIME OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A 
BALANCED DEFENCE FORCE WHICH HAS ADVANCED CAPABILITIES 
IN ALL SERVICES, ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE.

A BALANCED DEFENCE FORCE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WHOLE 
RANGE OF CONTINGENCIES WHICH MIGHT THREATEN OUR 
SECURITY CAN BE MET IN A CO-ORDINATED AND INTEGRATED 
WAY

          -2-

FOR LAND OPERATIONS, WE HAVE AN ARMY WHICH IS EQUIPPED 
WITH THE MANPOWER, FIRE POWER AND MOBILITY TO GIVE IT 
REAL TEETH.

APART FROM ITS OBVIOUS FIGHTER AND BOMBER CAPABILITIES, 
THE AIR FORCE COMMANDS EXTENSIVE RESOURCES NEEDED TO 
MEET THE TRANSPORT AND SURVEILLANCE NEEDS OF THE ARMED 
FORCES,

FOR ITS PART, THE NAVY OPERATES FAST PATROL BOATS AND 
LANDING CRAFT FOR IN-SHORE WORK AS WELL AS HIGHLY 
FLEXIBLE GUIDED MISSILE FRIGATES AND DESTROYERS WHICH 
CAN BE USED FOR BOTH IN-SHORE AND DEEP OCEAN TASKS.

MODERN WARFARE REQUIRES BOTH HIGH TECHNOLOGIES AND 
RAPID COMMUNICATIONS SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THESE 
CAPABILITIES ARE CO-ORDINATED EFFECTIVELY,

A MODERN AND SOPHISTICATED SHIP LIKE INVINCIBLE HAS 
A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DIRECTING MAJOR NAVAL TASK FORCE 
OPERATIONS,

         -3-

THE DEFENCE FORCE NEEDS ADVANCED COMMAND AND CONTROL 
FACILITIES WHICH CAN SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF TROOPS, 
AIRCRAFT AND SHIPS.

WITH ITS SPECIAL COMPUTERS AND CONTROL SYSTEMS 
INVINCIBLE WILL CONSTITUTE A KEY ELEMENT IN THE 
PROJECTION OF COMBINED AIR AND NAVAL POWER.

OPERATING WITH OUR LONG-RANGE ORION MARITIME CONTROL 
AIRCRAFT, THE F-111 STRIKE FORCE, THE FA-18'S, OUR 
GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES, INVINCIBLE 
WILL BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY POTENT DETERRENT TO ANY 
POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR.

IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE INVINCIBLE OFFERS THESE 
CAPABILITIES THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM IS VERY RELUCTANT 
TO PART WITH IT.

FAR FROM ACQUIRING SOMETHING WHICH IS SECOND-HAND OR 
OBSOLETE, AUSTRALIA IS ABLE TO OBTAIN A DEFENCE
SYSTEM WHICH IS REGARDED AS BEING AMONGST THE MOST 
ADVANCED IN THE WORLD.

H.M.S. INVINCIBLE WILL PROVIDE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 
INCREASE IN AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL DEFENCE CAPABILITIES, 
AND WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DETER 
AGGRESSION IN OUR OWN REGION IN THE DECADES AHEAD.

AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HEALTH DEPENDS ON 
BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE.

WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR TRADE ROUTES OPEN AND 
COUNTER ANY THREAT TO THEM.

SUBMARINES WOULD PRESENT THE MOST DIFFICULT TYPE OF 
THREAT FOR US TO COUNTER.

WITH INVINCIBLE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT AND DESTROY ANY 
SUBMARINE THREAT TO OUR TRADE ROUTES WILL BE SECOND TO 
NONE IN THE REGION.

FOR AUSTRALIA, A BALANCED DEFENCE FORCE MUST HAVE VERY 
HIGHLY DEVELOPED ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE CAPABILITY.

BUT INVINCIBLE IS NOT SIMPLY A PLATFORM FOR ANTI- 
SUBMARINE WARFARE.

         -5-

WHILE IT IS PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR OPERATING LARGE 
ANTI-SUBMARINE HELICOPTERS, IT IS NOT AIMED AT ANY 
SINGLE CONTINGENCY,

IT COULD BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF MILITARY
OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE CARRIAGE OF UP TO A BATTALION 
OF TROOPS, THE CO-ORDINATION OF AIR ELEMENTS AND THE 
DIRECTION OF NAVAL UNITS IN COMBAT,

WITH THESE FUNCTIONS IT ADDS A WIDE RANGE OF 
CAPABILITIES BEYOND THOSE NOW AVAILABLE TO US,

THE ACQUISITION OF A MAJOR NEW CAPABILITY LIKE
INVINCIBLE WILL NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO 
THE NEEDS OF A BALANCED DEFENCE FORCE BUT TO OUR 
SECURITY WITHIN OUR IMMEDIATE REGION,

GIVEN THE PRESENT THREAT LEVELS OF INTERNATIONAL TENSION, 
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO MAKE SURE THAT AUSTRALIA IS 
FULLY EQUIPPED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE 
WESTERN ALLIANCE,

          -6-

 WITH NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA 
 HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BOTH THE PACIFIC AND INDIAN 
 OCEANS, WHERE ADVANCED ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE 
 CAPABILITY AND HIGH GRADE COMMAND AND CONTROL 
 FACILITIES ARE ESSENTIAL.

 OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD IS NOT SO SECURE THAT WE 
 CAN TAKE POSSIBLE THREATS TO OUR SECURITY LIGHTLY.

 WHILE WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN 
 CENTRES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICT, WE CANNOT ASSUME WE WILL 
 NOT BE GRAVELY AFFECTED BY CONFLICT WHENEVER IT MAY 
 OCCUR.

 FOR EXAMPLE, THE SECURITY OF OUR TRADE ROUTES IS 
 ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECONOMIC SURVIVAL.

 THE FIELD OF DEFENCE IS ONE WHICH IS FRAUGHT WITH HARD 
 CHOICES FOR ALL DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.

WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS WHICH AT ONCE PROTECT OUR 
NATIONAL INTERESTS AND REPRESENT A REASONABLE INVESTMENT 
OF RESOURCES.
