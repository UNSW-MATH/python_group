PRESS STATEMENT                                         February 7th, 1961
MALCOLM FRASER

                  A REMINDER TQALy PENSIONERS OR POTENTIAL PENSIONERS
                  Malcolm Fraser today issued a reminder that early in March the
new Merged Means Test will come into operation. Every person who is getting a 
pension, but not the full pension, should make application to the Social Services 
Branch to have his or her pension reviewed to see whether or not under the Merged 
Means Test they are entitled to a higher pension,
                   Further, all those people who might previously have been refused 
a pension on the grounds of property or who have not applied for a pension because 
they thought they had too much property or income should have a look at the position 
to see whether or not they might be eligible when the new scheme comes into operation.
                    Broadly speaking the income side of the Means Test is not
altered, but whereas the old tans Test cut out property for any single person who 
had more than £2,250, under the new scheme the pension will not cut out property until 
that person has over £4,500, To give an example of how the alteration can affect 
pensions payable - a person with £2,250 property, but with no income, under the old 
scheme would get £60 pension. Under the new Merged Means Test that person would
get 0240 pension,  When I speak of property it should be remembered that a person's 
home, car and personal effects are entirely excluded from property„
                     If any person is in doubt as to whether he or she is eligible 
for a higher pension the best thing to do is to make enquiries to find out - nothing 
is lost if the enquiries are made and something might well be gained. If anyone 
wishes I will have enquiries made on their behalf if they will write to me.
