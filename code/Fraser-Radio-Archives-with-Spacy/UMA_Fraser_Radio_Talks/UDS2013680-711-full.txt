 DRAFT ELECTORATE TALK SUNDAY, 14 JUNE 1981

  THE FIRST PARLIAMENTARY SESSION FOR THIS YEAR FINISHED 
_ LAST FRIDAY.

  WE BEGAN THE SITTING WITH A GREAT DEAL TO DO

       AND WE HAVE ACHIEVED ALL OUR OBJECTIVES.

  IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND CONSTRUCTIVE 
  LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS FOR MANY YEARS.

  118 BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE SITTING

    -  AND THESE BILLS DEMONSTRATE IN THE PLAINEST TERMS 
       THE GOVERNMENT'S DIRECTION

    -  AND ITS DETERMINATION TO ACT IN THE INTERESTS
       OF ALL AUSTRALINS.

 OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM RE-AFFIRMS OUR VISION OF GROWTH 
 AND DEVELOPMENT FOR AUSTRALIA

    -  A VISION OF OPPORTUNITY, SECURITY, PROSPERITY, 
       STABILITY AND CONCERN FOR THOSE IN NEED.

 THIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM ALSO UNDERLINES UNMISTAKABLY OUR
 COMMITMENT TO STRONG AND EFFECTIVE, YET LIMITED, GOVERNMENT.

         2.

THE HISTORIC AND VISIONARY REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS 
SET THE OVERALL PATTERN OF THE SESSION'S LEGISLATION BASED 
UPON LIBERAL PRINCIPLES.

THAT REVIEW LED TO SOME 350 DECISIONS WHICH WERE AIMED AT

  - ELIMINATING DUPLICATION BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH 
   AND STATE GOVERNMENTS

  - PASSING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES WHICH
    IT CAN HANDLE BETTER THAN GOVERNMENT

  - AND RATIONALISING THE FUNCTIONS WHICH PROPERLY 
    BELONG TO THE COMMONWEALTH.

LIMITED GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SIGNIFY MEAN OR UNGENEROUS 
GOVERNMENT.

WHAT IT DOES IS ESTABLISH THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THERE 
CAN BE INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AND BETTER CARE FOR 
TOSE IN NEED.

THE REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS WAS TO A CONSIDERABLE 
EXTENT AN EXERCISE BY THE COMMONWEALTH IN ESTABLISHING ITS
OWN PRIORITIES

  - AND IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT WHILE THE
    REVIEW WILL LEAD TO SOME EXPENDITURE CUTS, IT 
    DOES NOT LEAD TO ANY REDUCTION IN INCOME SECURITY 
    ARRANGEMENTS.

          3.


CLOSELY LINKED TO THE REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS 
IS THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW HEALTH POLICY

  -  WHICH PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO INSURANCE AND 
    -ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES.

BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS POLICY LOOKS AFTER THE NEEDY AND 
THE DISADVANTAGED

  -  INDEED IT PROVIDES FOR FREE HEALTH CARE FOR 
     OVER 3 MILLION PEOPLE.

AND IT ELIMINATES THE SITUATION WHERE THE HEALTH COSTS OF 
THE WELL-TO-DO ARE PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS

  -  AND DEMANDS THAT ONE BUREAUCRACY RATHER THAN
     TWO WILL BE INVOLVED IN RUNNING EACH STATE'S PUBLIC 
     HOSPITALS

A FURTHER MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS SESSION HAS BEEN THE NEW 
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES.

SINCE 1975, THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY 
CONCERNED TO CURB ITS OWN EXPENDITURE

  -  FOR THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT TAXPAYERS CANNOT 
     BE REQUIRED TO PAY MORE AND MORE EVERY YEAR.

          4.

IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THAT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT 
MUST TAKE PART IN THE PROCESS OF EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT BY 
GOVERNMENTS

    BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS GIVE TO 
    THE STATES A MORE STABLE BASIS FOR THE GRANTS WHICH 
    THEY RECEIVE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH.

AND WHILE TALKING OF TAXES THERE IS FOR THE COMING YEAR A 
TAX CUT WHICH WILL LEAVE $500 MILLION MORE IN TAXPAYERS' 
POCKETS AND THE REBATE ON HEALTH INSURANCE IS EXPECTED TO 
REDUCE THE COMMONWEALTH'S REVENUE BY A FURTHER $500 MILLION 
IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

IN RECENT YEARS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF GROSS AND ANTI- 
SOCIAL TAX AVOIDANCE SCHEMES HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE

    AND IN THIS SESSION THE GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO 
    BRING FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE NEW ANTI-TAX 
    AVOIDANCE PROVISION DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THESE 
    SCHEMES.

ON TOP OF THESE MEASURES, THIS SESSION HAS SEEN LEGISLATION 
FOR THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND FOR FREEDOM OF 
INFORMATION.

       - 

                       5.

  BOTH THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION ARE IMPORTANT LIBERAL 
  INITIATIVES, AND THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION IN 
- -PARTICULAR MAKES AN IMPORTANT START IN AN AREA IN WHICH
  GOVERNMENTS HAVE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME AND DONE NOTHING.

  IT WAS THIS LIBERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH ACTED, WHERE OTHER 
  GOVERNMENTS HAD ONLY TALKED.

  IN ADDITION THERE WERE NEW AIRLINE ARRANGEMENTS

            WHICH ESTABLISHED AN INDEPENDENT AIRFARES
            COMMITTEE

       -    AND VERY CONSIDERABLE AMENDMENTS 'TO THE 
            BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION ACT.

  IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WERE PRESSURES DURING THE SESSION 

            THAT IS INEVITABLE WHEN SUCH A VOLUME OF
            LEGISLATION IS PRESENTED FOR DEBATE AND PASSAGE 
            THROUGH PARLIAMENT.

  BUT IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE A MOST SATISFACTORY RESULT.

  IT HAS BEEN AN EXCEPTIONALLY PRODUCTIVE SESSION
            WHICH WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING EFFECTS OF TREMENDOUS
            BENEFITS TO ALL AUSTRALIANS.
