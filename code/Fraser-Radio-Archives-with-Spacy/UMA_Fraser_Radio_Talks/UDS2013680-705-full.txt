ELECTORATE TALK                                   FOR SUNDAY, 17 tAY 1981
A FORTNIGHT AGO TRn corimmTvlaqi MET WITH STATE PREMIERS IN 
CANBERRA FOR THE FIRST PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND LOAM COUNCIL
MEETING IN 1981,

TONIGHT i WOULD LIKE TO STEP ASIDE FROM THE 7NEVITABLE ARGUMENTS 
AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES INVOLVED,

THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN
A FREE SOCIETY-   ABOUT CUTTING EP.< On BLOATED BUREAUCRACY                                        :744
                  ABOUT STREAMLINING AND MODERNISING GOVERNMENT - AND 
                  MAKING IT MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE EIGHTIES AND BEYOND
                  ABOUT REDUCING THE BURDEN OF TAXATION
                  AND ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE FREE TO SPEND YOUR 
                  EARNINGS AS YOU CHOOSE, OR ONLY AS THE GOVERNMENT
                  CHOOSES.

 NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO( GOVERNMENTS WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION 
 THAT THEY WOULD BE POPULAR IF THEY SPENT MONEY FREELY; 
                  THAT VOTES COULD BE BOUGHT,.

 IT WAS THAT PHILOSOPHY WHICH RAISED THE SHARE OF GOVERNMENT 
 FROM 31 CENTS IN EVERY EOLLAR•EARNED IN AUSTRALIA IN 1972/73 
 TO-7775ENTS ONLY TWO YEARS LATER IN 1974/75,

 IT Is P. MATTER OF HISTORY THAT THE SHARP INCREASE IN SPENDING
 WAS NOT PAID FOR AT THE TIME,_

;   4,
                                        -2-

          BUT WE HAVE PAID HEAVILY SINCE THROUGH THE INFLATION AND 
          UNEMPLOMENT TRIGGERED BY THE ICIBUDGET DEFICITS OF THOSE DAYS.

          WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED. TO TAKE TOUGH ACTION TO BRING THE DEFICIT 
          UNDER CONTROL.

          THE GOVERNMENT H*(6--KhD TO 'BORROW MASSIVE AMOUNTS TO   AY FOR THESE
          DEFICITS - AND THESE BORROWINGS INCREASINGLY RUN THE RISK 0 
          TAKING FUNDS PRIVATE ENTERPRISE NEEDS TO INCREAsE"JOBS.



          WE HAVE TO HOLD HACK GCNIaNKENT SPENDING SO THAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
          CAN CONTINUE TO GROW AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MAGNIFICENT 
          OPPORTUNITIES AUSTRALIA NOW AFFORDS,

          FORTUNATELY, T}-ERE Is _c-- CHANGE BLOWING THROUGH THE 
          AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY.

          PEOPLE ARE REALISING THAT       PMIENTS WHICH SPEND MONEY WILLY-NILLY
          ARE USING RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES •
          AND TO BUSINESSES TO SPEND IN THE WAYS THEY   THRmrLyBLS. WANT.

          THEY ARE REALISING THAT GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO SPEND MORE
          MONEY FIRST HAVE TO ThYE IT FROM THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN TAXES,
          OR BORROW IT IN A WAY WHICH HOLDS BACK JOB-CREATING DEVELOPMENTS.

•


           ON EVERY SIDE WE ARE 8EING TOLD "THERE IS '-'00  MUCH GOVERNMENT,
          TOO MUCH REGULATION", "TAXES ARE TOO HIGH". "THE GOVERNMENT 
           IS TAKING TOO MUCH", 'GIVE US TAX R,7:LIFF".

          A RESPONSIBLECANNOT REDur,E IRS UNLESS IT FIRST 
          CUTS ITS SPENDING.

          THAT WAS on, OF THE REASONS FOR THE RECENT REVIEW OF COMMON-WETTH 
          FUNCTIONS WHTCH IDENTInTre,D WAYS OF SAVING $560 MILLION A YEAR
          IN COMMONWEALTH OUTLAYS AND PRUNING 16 000 PUBLIC SERVICE PLACES

          AT THE PRENIERS CONYERENCE WE CAP,RIRD THE pRocEss A STAGE
          FURTHER     ....m.POSING RESTRAINTS ON THE TAX SHARING FUNDS PAID
          BY THE COMMONWEALTH TO THE STATES.

          IT IS NOT GENERALLY REALI -4) THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
          SPEND tiTTIST OVER HALF 0? ALL THE MONEY SPENT BY GOVERNMENTS IN 
          AUSTRALIA.

          BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY RPISE ONLY ONE FIFTH OF ALL THE TAxES,

          THE REST ARE R'z,1SED BY THE COMMOM4EA:JTH.

          THE STATES KEEP UP THEIR SPENDING 61.L'1 W.17)-1, THE HELP OF MASSIVE 
          PAYMENTS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH.

             FACT, ABOUT HALF THE FUNDS THE STATES SPEND ARE RAISED BY
          THE COMMOgWEALTH,

            4,

TO PUT IT SIMPLY, THE COMMONWEALTH COLLECTS THE TAXES AND THE 
STATES SPEND THEM.

THIS FMANS THAT IF THERE ARE TO tE TAX CUTS THEN ALL LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT, STATE AS WELL AS COMMONWEALTH, HAVE TO REIN IN 
THEIR SPENDING,

THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER THE STATES WILL TAKE THE LEAD FROM 
THE COMMONWEALTH AND CUT THEIR SPENDING.

WHY SHOULD THEN?

THEY ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE BLAMED FOR HAvING TO RAISE TAXES 
OR WHO WILL TAKE THE CREDIT IF TAXES ARE CUT.

MAKE. NO MISTAKE, THE STATES HAVE DONE VERY WEI-J. OUT OF THE
COMMONWEALTH IN THE EAST,

UNDER THS-AtttMENT ORIGINALLY NEGOTIATED BY THE PREVIOUS 
COMMONWEALTH GOVZRNMENT, THE STATES' GENERAL REVENUE FIATS - THE
MONIES THE STATES CAN SPEND AS THEY PLEASE - ROSE AT AN AVERAGE 
RATE OF 5.5 PER CENT PER YEAR (EVEN WHEN INFLATION IS TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT) IN THE FOUR YEARS TO 1979/80.

TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET SPENDING GREW BY UNDER i PER CENT
PER ANNUM IN REAL TERMS OVER THE SAME PERIOD,

WHEN THIS AGREEMENT CAME TO AN END, WE TOLD THE STATES IN NO 
UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT IT WAS MUCH TOO GENEROUS.

q




        THE COMON;,TEALTHSTKPLY COULD NOT      'ORD TO cn ON TREATING
        THE STATES BETTER THAN IT WAS TREATING ITSELF,


        WI.LAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS ASKING THEM To BEAR A Smi,J,T, DECLINE 
        IN REAL TERmS IN THEIR TAX SHARING FUNDS

                       THEY WILL STILL INCREASE BY 9 PER CENT IN MONEY TERMS.


        TnEREFTERI THEY WILL RECEI,t, A FIKED SKARE OF TOTAL COMmoNwEALTH
        TAX REVENUES,


        UNDER THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT, THE STATES WILL FARE NO BETTER AND 
        NO WORSE-11-HA4 THE COMMONWEALTH ITSELF,


        THEY WILL BE INSULATED FROM CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE 
        OF THE DIFFERENT SORTS OF TAX.„


        IF PAST EXPERIENCE IS ANY GUIDE. THEIR REVENUE WILL BE SOMEwliAc- 
        MORE STABLE THAN IF THEY WERE LINKED TO PERSONAL INCOME TAX
        RECEIPT,     WHERE IS THE INJUSTICE IN THAT?



            "MOST SEEMED AS IF WE WENT INTO THE PREMIERS CONFERENCE AS
        THE SOLE MPREsENTATIvE or THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYER.


        IN Cug V1FW THE TAXPAYER IS ALREADY CARRYING A HEAVY BURDEN AND 
        THE TIME HAS COMB TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYER AGAINST THE EVER-GROWING 
        DEKANDs OF GOVERNMENT,


        WE SUCCEEDED IN OUR AIM AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE,

TE HAVE 'UT THE BRAXES ON THEUNCONTROLLEp PUB'LIC SPEND:ING.


WITHOUT THAT/ THERE WOULD BF NO HOP E OF GENUINE TX RE,LIET
IN THE FORMABLE FUTUR1z.
