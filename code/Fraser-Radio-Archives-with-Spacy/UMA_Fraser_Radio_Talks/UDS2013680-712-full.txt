THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PROGRAMME IS DESIGNED TO BRING 
ABOUT STABLE, NON-INFLATIONARY GROWTH,

AND THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAMME IS NOW RECOGNISED AROUND 
THE WORLD,

THE ECONOMY IS BUOYANT,

PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYMENT ARE IMPROVING,

UNEMPLOYMENT WAS DOWN BY 53,000 IN THE LAST YEAR, AND THE 
JUNE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS THE LOWEST FOR FOUR YEARS,

IT IS PARTICULARLY HEARTENING THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL 
FALL IN UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE,

THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER 19 NOW UNEMPLOYED IS THE 
LOWEST FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

PRIVATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS GROWING STRONGLY,

THERE IS CONFIDENCE IN AUSTRALIA
  - AND OUR PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE ARE EXTREMELY 
    HEARTENING,

THE OECD EXPECTS THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO GROW MORE RAPIDLY 
THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER MEMBER COUNTRY IN 1981 AND ALSO IN 1982.
  - IT PREDICTS A GROWTH RATE OF OVER 5% FOR BOTH 
    THOSE YEARS.

               2.


BUT THERE ARE ALSO DANGERS IN OUR PRESENT SITUATION
   - AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF US ALL
     TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT THROW AWAY THE 
   -- GMAT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH NOW LIE BEFORE US,

IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION AND STRIKE 
ACTIVITIES HAVE CAUSED GREAT AND UNWARRANTED INCONVENIENCE 
TO THE COMMUNITY,

AND THE SELFISH WAGE PUSH BY MILITANT UNIONS CAN THREATEN 
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS IN THIS COUNTRY,

IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS DANGER THAT WAGE RISES WILL RENEW 
INFLATION
   - WHICH-REP'AINS THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO 
     IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA,

THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR RESTRAINT BY ALL SECTIONS OF THE 
COMMUNITY TO RESTRAIN INFLATION
   - FOR THE SUCCESS OF OUR POLICIES IN PRODUCING 
     ECONOMIC GROWTH IS ALREADY PRODUCING 
     INFLATIONARY PRESSURES,

IF THE AMOUNT THAT WE PRODUCE AS A NATION GOES UP BY THREE 
PER CENT, FOUR PER CENT OR FIVE PER CENT IN A YEAR
   - AND WE TRY TO GET WAGE INCREASES OF TEN OR 
     FIFTEEN PER CENT OR MORE EACH YEAR
   - IT IS INEVITABLE THAT COSTS AND PRICES WILL GO
     UP, AND WE WILL BE BACK ON THE INFLATION MERRYGOROUND,

EXCESSIVE WAGE RISES DAMAGE US ALL,

THE PROSPERITY CURRENTLY BEING ACHIEVED IN AUSTRALIA IS 
WELCOME AND RATIFYING,

IT IS A TRIBUTE TO THE SOUND ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT THIS 
GOVERNMENT HAS PURSUED.

HOWEVER, IT MUST NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED,

ONE INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT IN COMBATTING INFLATION IS 
CO-OPERATION,

INCREASING OVERALL PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON THE ACTIONS OF MILLIONS 
OF INDIVIDUAL AUSTRALIANS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PUT ASIDE 
PERSONAL SHORT-TERM GAINS FOR MORE IMPORTANT, LONG-TERM GOALS,

THE PURSUIT OF EXCESSIVE WAGE DEMANDS CAN ONLY HINDER 
CONSISTENT ECONOMIC RECOVERY,

THE BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH NOW OCCURRING IN THIS 
COUNTRY MUST BE SHARED BY ALL AUSTRALIANS
  - AND NOT BE ALLOWED SIMPLY TO FALL INTO THE HANDS 
    OF MILITANT UNIONS,

THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT FORCE PEOPLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE,

               4,

IT CANNOT DO AWAY WITH THE SELFISHNESS OF MILITANT UNIONS 
TRYING TO GRAB THE BENEFITS OF PROSPERITY FOR THEIR OWN 
MEMBERS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY,
THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT IT CAN TO PROTECT THE 
INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
   - AND TO ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF CLIMATE IN WHICH REASONABLE
     SOLUTIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED.

BUT THERE IS A VAST NEED FOR A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS 
AREA THAT IS SHARED BY ALL AUSTRALIANS,

LAST FRIDAY, AFTER A SPECIAL MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF 
GOVERNMENT, THE ACTU AND EMPLOYER GROUPS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
ARBITRATION COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A REVIEW OF THE WAGE FIXATION 
PRINCIPLES
   - AND CALLED FOR A PRELIMINARY HEARING NEXT WEDNESDAY
     OF THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE FOR IT TO CONSIDER 
     PROCEDURAL MATTERS AND TO FIX A TIMETABLE,

THE GOVERNMENT WELCOMES THIS INITIATIVE FROM THE ARBITRATION 
COMMISSION
   - AND BELIEVES THAT THIS APPROACH CAN BE OF BENEFIT
     SO FAR AS THE OPERATION OF THE WAGE GUIDELINES IS 
     CONCERNED,

IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH NOBODY CAN AFFORD TO LET SLIP.

THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT ALL INDUSTRIAL ACTION MUST 
BE CALLED OFF DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS,
UNLESS THE DAMAGING INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION THAT HAS BEEN 
ALL TOO CQMMON IN RECENT TIMES IS STOPPED.
  - THE POTENTIAL PROVIDED BY THIS INITIATIVE FOR MORE
    STABLE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CANNOT POSSIBLY BE FULFILLED.

ALL AUSTRALIANS WILL FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF A FAILURE TO MAKE 
THE MOST OF THIS OPPORTUNITY,

BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, THE PROSPERITY OF AUSTRALIA 
WILL BE INCREASINGLY SHARED BY ALL AUSTRALIANS,
