    Leader of the Opposition

   FOR PRESS

   ELECTORAL TALK

   THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE NOW LAUNCHED THE FRAMEWORK OF 
   PHILOSOPHY AND IDEAS WHICH IS THE BASIS OF OUR DEVELOPING 
   POLICIES.

   IT IS NOW BEING EXPLAINED THAT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IS
   LIMITING THE FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUALS IN TWO WAYS - THROUGH THE 
   EXCESSIVE POWERS THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND COMMISSIONS ARE
•  TAKING TO THEMSELVES, AND SECONDLY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF 
   INFLATION, WHICH AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRESSIVE TAXATION SCALE 
   DETERMINES HOW A GROWING PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUAL INCOME IS 
   SPENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   OUR POLICIES WILL DEAL WITH BOTH THESE AREAS WHICH ARE AT THE 
   HEART OF THE GOVERNMENTS DIFFICULTIES.

   THE PRIME MINISTERS DESIRE TO CENTRALISE POWER IN CANBERRA AND 
   TO AMASS THERE A BUREAUCRACY WHICH PERVADES EVERY ASPECT OF 
   AUSTRALIAN LIFE HAS PLAYED ITS SIGNIFICANT PART IN PRODUCING THE 
   ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH IS CAUSING SUCH WIDESPREAD CONCERN IN THE 
i  COMMUNITY.
   THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER NOW WORKS AT LEAST THREE MONTHS OF THE
   YEAR FOR A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS MORE CONCERNED WITH
   THE JOB OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, WITH SEWERS, CURBING AND GUTTERING
   THAN WITH ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY AND PROSPERITY, DEFENCE PREPAREDNESS,
   INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT

   THE LIBERAL PHILOSOPHIES WHICH HAVE BEEN OUTLINED SET OUT A 
   FRAMEWORK AGAINST WHICH POLICIES WILL BE DEVELOPED.

   THEY SHOW THAT WE HAVE A COHERENT VIEW OF THE INDIVIDUALS ROLE 
   IN SOCIETY AND THEY PROVIDE A BACKGROUND TO OUR POLICIES.

  POLICY DEVELOPMENT IS A CONTINUING PROCESS AND ONE THAT IS 
  WELL UNDERWAY.

  THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS POLICY HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AND QUITE
  SHORTLY NEW POLICIES ON FEDERALISM, IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGN 
  AFFAIRS WILL BE PUBLISHED.

  LATER, THERE WILL ALSO BE POLICY PAPERS ON DEFENCE, EDUCATION 
  AND SOCIAL SECURITY.

  DEVELOPMENT OF THESE POLICIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LIBERAL
• AND NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTIES WANT TO BE SUPPORTED BECAUSE OF 
  THEIR OWN POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING 
  AUSTRALIA, AND NOT MERELY BECAUSE OF THE DISMAY AT THE POLICIES 
  BEING FOLLOWED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS NOW SO EVIDENT.

  WE BELIEVE THESE POLICIES WILL WIN ENDURING SUPPORT.

  THE OPPOSITIONS NEXT MAJOR STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC ISSUES WILL 
  BE MADE LATER THIS MONTH IN THE REPLY TO THE BUDGET ADDRESS.

  IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE A LARGE 
  NUMBER OF QUITE SPECIFIC OPPOSITION COMMITMENTS ALREADY ON 
  RECORD.
• THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE SAID AND I HAVE REPEATED IT 
  CONSTANTLY AT PUBLIC MEETINGS, THAT THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION 
  TRIBUNAL WILL BE ABOLISHED.

  THIS BODY HAS QUITE PATENTLY FAILED TO STOP PRICES RISING.

  DURING THE PERIOD OF ITS OPERATION THE NATION HAS SEEN ITS 
  WORST EVER PERIOD OF INFLATION.

  THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A SITUATION
  IN WHICH BUSINESSES ARE GOING BROKE. THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF 
  LIQUIDITY AND THEY ARE CONCERNED FOR THEIR SURVIVAL.

               -3-

  MANY ARE BEING FORCED INTO LOSS SITUATIONS TO THE DETRIMENT OF 
  THEIR OVERALL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND 
  INCREASED EMPLOYMENT.

  WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO RESTORE THE INITIAL INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE
  FOR NEW PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF 40% TO ENABLE FIRMS TO START 
  CREATING JOBS AGAIN.

  WE HAVE SAID QUITE UNIQUIVOCABLY THAT ON OUR RETURN TO 
  GOVERNMENT THE INIQUITOUS TAX SURCHARGE ON INCOME FROM 
• INVESTMENTS WILL BE ABOLISHED.
  WE HAVE PROMISED TAX CONCESSIONS FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES TO 
  ENCOURAGE FURTHER INVESTMENT AND TO BURY FINALLY LABOR'S 
  PROPOSALS FOR A TAX ON CAPITAL GAIN.

  WE HAVE ALSO PROMISED A MAJOR ENQUIRY INTO INFLATION ACCOUNTING.

  THE OPPOSITION PARTIES STAND FOR A STEP BY STEP REDUCTION IN 
  THE PRESENT LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES AS GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE 
  IS REINED IN AND AS INFLATION IS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL.

  IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS WE STAND FOR AN INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY
• CONCENTRATED IN OUR OWN PART OF THE WORLD WITH THE BASIC 
  OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY.

  WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE SOVIET NAVAL BUILD UP 
  IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF SINO RUSSIAN 
  COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE IN SOUTH EAST ASIA.

  WE WILL SEEK THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION 
  WITH ALL COUNTRIES NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT 
  ALTHOUGH WE WOULD EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CLOSER RELATIONSHIPS 
  WITH THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIMILAR SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT 
  AND WHERE OUR PHILOSOPHICAL COMMITMENTS ARE CLEAR.

                -4-




  IN DEFENCE, WE STAND FOR PROPER MARITIME SURVEILLANCE ON OUR 
  COASTLINE AND FOR A NAVY CAPABLE OF OPERATING IN TWO OCEANS.


  THE AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY CAN BE REGARDED AS A VITAL ONE 
  AND DEFENCE ORDERS WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS IT.

                            A    fo
  ALL THIS ADDS UP TO QUITE AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SPECIFIC P IoDi6, 
  APART FROM THE POLICY STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
  FORMULATED OR WHICH ARE NOW BEING WORKED ON.


• THE OPPOSITION PARTIES INTEND TO RESTORE A PROSPEROUS PROGRESSIVE 
  AUSTRALIA IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS HAVE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO
  PLAN THEIR OWN FUTURES, AND THE FUTURES OF THEIR FAMILIES, WITH 
  A MINIMUM OF GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.


  THROUGHOUT THE WEST, AND PARTICULARLY IN AUSTRALIA OVER THE LAST 
  22 YEARS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE GROWN LARGER AND MORE BUREAUCRATIC, 
  CENTRALIZING POWER AT THE EXPENSE OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM.


  THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WILL FIGHT THAT GROWTH IN THE INTEREST OF 
  INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING.
