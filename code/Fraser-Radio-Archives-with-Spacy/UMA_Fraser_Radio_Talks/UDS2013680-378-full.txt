   ]yyt afte r a           of thought because I bells:   e    diff   ult to say

    ethitg useful in        field. Very often in the past too much has be

 said und too little be been dca.ta. Too much has bdea                   as

 propaganda in order        tract the eyes of the uncommitted nat

 international affairs there is a great need, for etateemexts =rye         behalf 

 of all countries to be objective. I realize the immense diffiQC~           that

 thus is in being entirely objective in the making of any siate;le.

 people ea     warned to some degree by their environment 1ronmeat, a nd this is

 understandable; but others, of whom there may be some          his House, lean

 over backwards   o be fair to the other side. I should like to explain

 what I meat by that observation with a short analogy         ~ban I was at

 the university, a new young tutor was chosen to set the examination on in 

    Jeot for all the students of the university who were in a certain year. 

 The Young tutor was terrified ut the thought that the older dons might s.y 

 that he had set a paper that was specially designed to take it easy far

 his own students to pas      Therefore, he set a paper containing questions

  bout aspects of the courbe on which he bad not coached his own pupils. 

   ere was not one question in it that his own students could answer.

    t is what I call leaning over backwards to be fair to the other side. 

            It any be wrong to be governed tao much by environ<ent when 

         eying to be objective in dieouasin major problems, but it is 

 a betrayal of trust to go too far towards the other extreme. The tutor

whom I have mentioned betrayed his students, Any politician or statesman 

who acts similarly in major political tters betrays his o* people and 

his oen background

               cent exchanges between s      of the -   or           ve

 indicated t :, harm that lies in playing to an suions                 c-nte

 inter          exchange*. x'laying to au audience makes it                 to

be objective, because, in public exchanges, statesmen are always thinking

of the uncomaitted nations, and trying to attract them a little ssare to 

their side, or at least a little further away from the opposing side.

      `      if any ,eet`u3. purpose is to be ssr ed, negotiationsbetwe

             Feary play a much larger part to negotiations in the pre 
 international situation than any of us would like to think, or would
admit. Its extent of ite influence depends             on the character    and courage
ofinterr tiional leaders, and it Is imeossib1e tri gauge, beoeuse zoo world
leader could over admit to fear              evcrtheleas, it is e very real emotion 
and l ea sure that it exists ezong international. le dorm, We hove the 
basic fear of eilÌtent or subversive Russien commun am. Traditionally,     1tionally,
Russia has had e fear of the West. _ven pst the prey nt time Mussia'o 
occupation of eastern turopean oountriee, in addition to being bused on 
the Comaumist philosophy, could be motivated by Ruseir's very great fear 
of a revival of e united Germany, which could dominate urope as f ixm y 
end vigorously as Germany has core in the pest.
             I believe that fear enters greatly into ne -tuions over
disarmament.'ihere is the fear th nt an agreement would not be kept, 
because it could not be adequately supervised or unforced. ft present, 
we have the protection of our own known streeet . end deterrents. These 
are kio nr But after an agroceent following negotiation, which must be 
e clear and plain objective , there would be marl things that were not 
known and were ilmck perhaps a matter of value judgment or et opinion. 
For this reason , it will take greet courage to sign an agreement with 
the Co untel powers. These fears are legitimate, becuuse the position 
of the world would ba infinitely worse if nn agreement were signed, and 
then proved to be a failure. MD sigaiag of an egreement on disci element 
will take great courega also because an agreemamt oannot be based
entirely on fact. bany fears arise from ignorance, and these san, be 
destroyed by research into fecund by knowledge. But other fears arise 
because value sudgmcn. ts or =otters of opinion are involved, and these 
thin e can never be absolute or certain. Hero the human element con- 
stituted by the strength, the oharaater, the integrity, and the deter- 
mination of national leaders beoomss of supremo importance. Any agree- 
ment with the noviet Union will be based almost wholly an feet, but 
there will be an element of opinion or value judgment in it, and on this 
element the fate of the world may well hang.
