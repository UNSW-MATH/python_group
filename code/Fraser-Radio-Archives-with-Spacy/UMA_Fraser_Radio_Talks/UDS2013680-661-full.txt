   the size of electorates are the-enrolled voters of Australia. 
   They-are the- people with a commitment and with a responsibility.'

   This referendum- is also-designed to tell the States how they 
   must elect their members of Parliament. People in the States 
  .are. quite capable of making these decisions themselves and do 
   not need. Canberra to tell them how.

   The third referendum is to make it possible for the Commonwealth 
   directly to provide funds for the local government. They-can 
   do that now if they want to, through the States and from
   Section 96 grants. The referendum is only necessary if the 
   Government has the intention of bypassing the States, of cutting 
   off their feet.ghe Government has in fact embarked on a long 
   term policy of squeezing the States from both directions. It 
   is determined to reduce the area of State responsibility by 
   increasing use of tied grants and by taking over, additional State 
   responsibilities.

  -From the-other-direction the Commonwealth is committed to using 
  -local-government in a way that would also reduce the responsibilities
----of-States.- The      would be-- abolition of the States. 
   The-grants. to local government would also, of course, be tied,
 - the money would have to be spent in certain ways. Canberra would
   control all activity.

 - ,The fourth7referendUn would make it easier for future referendum
 7 to--be carried by reducing from 4 to 3 the number of States that 
   must approve the proposal. That with the other measures will 
   also be opposed.

  -There is"-a, fifth-proposal but that will not be put to referendum 
   at the same time as the Senate election. The nain thrust of the 
   Proposals in their totality would be to make. Canberra more 
   powerful and the States weaker. Such measures Will be opposed.

nobody likes double standards wherever they may appear; whatever 
the form may be in The Government is applying a double standard 
in its education 'payments. Por a long while the Labor Party 
licked the previous government because we believed and believe 
all`.ndependent schools ought to be given a certain predictable 
basis grant to assist with their running costs.

The Labor Party opposed this and said that the funds should be 
made available on the basis of needs alone. The Prime Minister 
confirmed that view in answer to a question last week. Now it 
âpnelars that the Commonwealth is using the needs criteria for 
oayzents that it makes to independent schools right across Australia 
but for schools in the Australian Capital Territory and in the 
northern Territory the Commonwealth as paying, in addition, a 
flat per capita grant of 20; of the cost of the education for 
children in Government schools.

That payment involves a quite different pris,r:ipl.ep

One standard is applied for Australia another. quite different 
stan;dard is applied in the Comtrlonwe.a -..th,'s o;-rrz totritories.

that for the. Government Dr Cairns, Hr Crean and the Prime Minister
