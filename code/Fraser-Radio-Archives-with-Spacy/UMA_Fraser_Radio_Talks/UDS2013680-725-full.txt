ELECTORATE TALK FRIDAY P.M. DRAFT
GOVERNMENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS

1981 HAS BEEN A YEAR OF ACHIEVEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION,

THE GOVERNMENT HAS MAINTAINED AND STRENGTHENED ITS COMMITMENT 
TO THE FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT INDIVIDUAL AUSTRALIANS HAVE THE 
RIGHT AND MUST HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES
THEIR OWN NEEDS AND PRIORITIES,

THIS BELIEF WAS GIVEN PARTICULAR CONCRETE EXPRESSION THIS YEAR 
IN THE REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS

   - FOR FROM THAT REVIEW HAVE COME DECISIONS AIMED AT
     STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE 
     AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

   - AS WELL AS ACHIEVING A MORE APPROPRIATE BALANCE
     OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE COMMONWEALTH AND 
     THE STATES.

BUT IN AN IMPORTANT SENSE, THE REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH FUNCTIONS 
WAS SIMPLY A CONTINUATION OF THE PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY PURSUED FOR SIX YEARS

   - WHICH HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A MORE
     PROSPEROUS AND CONFIDENT AUSTRALIA.

IN 1980/81, THE BENEFITS OF THOSE POLICIES NOT ONLY BECAME 
MORE APPARENT, BUT WERE SHARED BY ALL AUSTRALIANS

           2,

   - AND NOTHING ILLUSTRATES THIS MORE CLEARLY THAN
     THE FACT THAT AUSTRALIAN HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVED AN 
     INCREASE IN THEIR REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES, AFTER 
     TAX OF NEARLY $3 BILLION IN 1980/81,
ECONOMIC SUCCESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED ACROSS A WIDE FRONT,

WHILE THERE ARE INCREASING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, WHICH ARE IN PART A PRODUCT OF THE 
ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, INFLATION IN THE 
YEAR TO SEPTEMBER WAS CONTAINED TO JUST OVER 9%

   - THIS IS BELOW THE LEVEL OF TWELVE MONTHS AGO

   - AND IT IS STILL BELOW WORLD LEVELS, ALTHOUGH IT
     IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN OUR 
     COMPETITIVE EDGE,
1981 WAS ALSO A YEAR IN WHICH THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION 
WAS SEEN MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER BEFORE, NOT AS AN END IN 
ITSELF, BUT AS A MEANS OF ACHIEVING GREATER INVESTMENT, 
MORE JOBS AND HIGHER LIVING STANDARDS FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS,

THE MAIN FOUNDATION FOR OUR RECENT OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE 
LIES IN THE RENEWED CONFIDENCE OF BUSINESS TO INVEST IN ALL 
SECTORS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,

FOR WHILE REAL PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN MOST OTHER INDUSTRIAL 
COUNTRIES IS FLAT OR DECLINING, PRIVATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT 
IN AUSTRALIA ROSE BY OVER 21% IN REAL TERMS IN 1980/81 - THE 
STRONGEST GROWTH IN THREE DECADES,

           3,

PRODUCTION AND CONSUMER DEMAND HAVE BEEN STRONG

   - AND SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYMENT GROWTH HAS BEEN
     ACHIEVED,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S ABUNDANT RESOURCES - 
ESPECIALLY OUR OIL AND NON-OIL ENERGY RESOURCES - WAS 
ACCELERATED DURING 1981

   - AND AUSTRALIA NOW HAS A ROLE AS A SIGNIFICANT
     ENERGY SUPPLIER TO AN ENERGY HUNDRY WORLD, A 
     ROLE WHICH WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE TO THE WORLD 
     ECONOMY, AND TO OURSELVES,

OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS HAS NOT COME ABOUT BY CHANCE,

IT HAS REQUIRED MAINTENANCE OF THE RIGHT POLICIES

   - POLICIES OF SOUND AND RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC
     MANAGEMENT,

MOREOVER THE GOVERNMENT HAS INTEGRATED ITS PROMOTION OF 
THE CONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY WITH 
POLICIES OF CARE AND CONCERN FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE,

IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL WELFARE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND OVER 
$11,300 MILLION THIS FINANCIAL YEAR - APPROACHING 30 PER CENT 
OF TOTAL BUDGET OUTLAYS,

1981 HAS SEEN THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCE SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVES 
IN INCREASING BENEFITS FOR THE HANDICAPPED, FOR VETERANS 
AND FOR FAMILIES

   - AND THE PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE FOR MIGRANTS,
     ABORIGINES AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAS CONTINUED TO 
     RECEIVE A HIGH PRIORITY.

UNDER THE NEW HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS INTRODUCED THIS 
YEAR

   - THERE IS PROVISION FOR SOME THREE MILLION NEEDY
     AUSTRALIANS TO HAVE THEIR HEALTH COSTS MET BY 
     GOVERNMENT

   - WHILE THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO INSURE THEMSELVES
     AGAINST THE COST OF MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL BILLS HAVE 
     BEEN GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO DO SO IN THE FORM OF A 
     TAX REBATE.

1981 HAS ALSO SEEN OTHER SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS,

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED

   - AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION HAS BEEN
     ESTABLISHED,

NEW ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE MAJOR 
DOMESTIC AIRLINES - AND THERE HAS BEEN A RATIONALISATION OF 
THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF AIR FARES.

           5.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S STATED AIM OF CLAMPING 
DOWN ON TAX AVOIDANCE, A NUMBER OF SCHEMES HAVE BEEN OUTLAWED 
BY THE PARLIAMENT
   - AND THROUGH CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED NEW
     LEGISLATION WE HAVE SOUGHT TO PREVENT NEW 
     SCHEMES SPRINGING UP TO REPLACE THEM,

AND IN FULFILMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ELECTION PROMISE, 
THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO 
ALLOW UNIONISTS TO DEMAND SECRET BALLOTS BEFORE TAKING 
INDUSTRIAL ACTION,

OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE IN 1981 HAS BEEN THE GOVERNMENT'S 
COMMITMENT TO MAKING A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL 
AFFAIRS, PARTICULARLY IN OUR OWN REGION,
THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN MELBOURNE 
DID MUCH TO FOCUS WORLD ATTENTION ON THOSE PROBLEMS FACING 
BOTH THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING NATIONS,
OUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESSES SIGNIFIES OUR COMMITMENT TO THE NEED FOR A JUST 
AND LASTING PEACE IN THAT TROUBLED REGION.
1981 HAS PRESENTED CHALLENGES AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES TO 
THIS NATION

   - AND I BELIEVE THAT IN GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITIES
     AND ATTEMPTING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE

R
             6,

        CHALLENGES, THE GROUNDWORK HAS BEEN PREPARED 
        FOR FURTHER DESIRABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN 1982,

   I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WISH YOU ALL A 
   HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND A SUCCESSFUL AND SATISFYING 1982,
