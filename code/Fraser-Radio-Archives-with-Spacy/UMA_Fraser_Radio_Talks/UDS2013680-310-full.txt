       Victorio as wh    needs a new port, .rnd in the sutuse tide need
sill •beoome sore rcent. T:le port must be ploed to sup,ly the needs of 
cress farthes, from _elbow:Jae nod Geelong uo tSat people usy be sivea the 
advantoses. of quieker and more direct transport.
       iiiWi the Portland harbour Trust took over control of the harbour 
and besAn the sonstruetion of a fully essiksed deep see port. it ik expect- 
ed that the first two new berths will be completed in two years, slthoush 
the fiaal undertakins eill take about twenty years. The kortlsad arbour 
scheme hsd been cantemplsted for a long time, but now the first six huadred 
feet of the main brockwster have been built, es any visitor to iortlaad
can see.
       This dev lopment iu soias to mesa a greet des' to the people of 
e,snnons aamilton aad Casterton are rousha. ity miles from Portland, less 
than ono third the distance to Sclbourae, and rail chrrsos tould be corree-
pendinsly lower. Ilarrow, ahope aad Eorbilam are also nesr,.r Portland 
than Lelbourne or Geelans. Withi a superphosphate works at Portland many 
farmers would be able to collect their own supslios, wskiag the round trip 
in a day, whereas at present they have to depend upon an irresular railrosd 
service from LlelSourne or Goelonst Iencias supslies, iron aid essicultura 
equipment would also come direct to Portland from thLlr ,:ort of embarkatien 
thus reaohing their users more cheaply nad more sufckly. Lt the same time, 
raw materials for local isIsustry would reaoh Wannon far more eccaomioally.
       Portland already ships abrocd considerable quantities of moat from 
Borthwicks% batter, chesee and wool, hile in the list few months the first 
shipment of barley for twenty years was reoently saut abroad.
      .Trade both inward and outward from Portland will greatly iaoreace. 
For the people of Lannon it is the nsturol trading oentre„ bciad °loser 
than other ports where there are oonsiderable delays due to osatralis:tion. 
Wool lsavias Samilton can often be sold more quickly In Landon than in 
Melbourne. Goods on reach the farms and footoriee of Waaaon more cheaply 
and at the same time export throush Portland is quicker and cheaper, and 
this is ma important point when there is keen competition in sellind our 
products abrosd. Apart from the question os eocaomy and effioiency, the 
possession of another fully esaipped deep ea port will be invaluable as 
a defonoe measure*
