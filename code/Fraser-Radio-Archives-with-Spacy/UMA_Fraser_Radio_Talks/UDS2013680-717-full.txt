                  ELECTORATE TALK


We live in a troubled and uncertain world, in which it sometimes 
seems that stability and a clear sense of direction are almost 
the exception rather than the rule.

The assassination of President Sadat is not only a tragedy for 
his country and for stability in the Middle East, but it also 
serves to--remind us of the damage that is caused when 
unreasonableness and division are allowed to take first place in 
human affb.irs.

In 1977, after 30 years of continual warfare in the Middle East, 
President Sadat made his historic and courageous visit to 
Jerusalem to add.ress the Knesset, and thus opened the path to
negotiation in the est for peace. And then in 1979, the 
Egyptian/Israeli peace treaty was signed. I said at the time 
that the world hoped that work on a comprehensive Middle East 
settlement 1)ouid~rc.ceed in the aftermath of that treaty. 
But now, while it is obviously too early to assess the full 
`consequences that will flow from President Sadat's assassination, 
the world clearl_• has to cope with the aftermath .of a tragedy.

Not everyone'; as we know, agreed with what President Sadat was 
doing, although everyone must surely respect him for his courage 
and his objectives of peace and stability and certainly no
benefits will follow from what has taken place.

The assassination of President Sadat is not an isolated incident. 
There have been at least five other assassinations and attempted 
assassinations of world leaders during this year. It is never easy 
to learn lessons or draw conclusions from this kind of madness 
and terror. Some say that the world has lost its way and certainly 
there are many people in the world who are disturbingly uncertain. 
about where 'th e course of progress really lies. But by the same 
token, there are ocher people who are so fanatical in the.)_r own 
convictions and aspirations that they lack a sense of balance.

 In a troubled world, we surely-need a sense of our own direction 
and objectives as a nation, and we need above all to be realistic. 
We need to be willing to face up to problems, and confront issues 
head on. There is a need for firmness, together with an open 
 and Erin'_ apnroach.

The civilised discussion of major human issues requires more 
support than ever before. That is why the value of meetings 
such as the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Melbourne 
cannot be over-estimated. The Commonwealth is, as President 
Kaunda of Zambia said in Melbourne, a civilised association 
of nations. Around the conference table and in private 
discussions, more than a quarter of the world's leaders proposed 
and considered ways of making the world'a better place to live-in.i} • 
The Commonwealth has, over the years, and particularly in relation' 
to Zimbabwe and Namibia, displayed vision and courage-in- 
seeking practical means for the settlement of international 
conflicts. At the Melbourne meeting, difficult 'and contentious' 
issues were tackled and firm specific statements resulted.

There was a real commitment to build on the good will that exists 
within the Commonwealth, in order to bring practical proposals 
to the dialogue about issues of poverty and development and 
to other problems as well.

Z am proud that such a successful conference was held in
Australia•, and our ..visitors so enjoyed the friendliness which 
they encountered here that they have become ambassadors for 
Australia.
The Commonweal        ors, with their determined practicality,
their refusal to be distracted from the central themes, and 
their willingness to discuss issues openly with each other, 
have' set an exa_cle for others to follow in the vision and 
sincerity u their __.._d=ership.
