POSSIBLE ELECTORATE TALK - INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWING

LAST WEEK I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES INVOLVED 
IN THE NOW TAX SHARING ARRANGEMENTS THE COMMONWEALTH 
PROPOSED AT THE RECENT PREMIERS' CONFERENCE.

I POINTED OUT THAT WE WERE ASKING THE STATES TO ACCEPT 
THEIR SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING THE 
TAXPAYER AGAINST THE DANGER OF EVER GROWING DEMANDS 
BY GOVERNMENTS
    THEIR SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FREEING- 
    UP RESOURCES TO ALLOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO 
    GROW.

TONIGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER AREA OF
STATE ACTIVITY IN WHICH RESTRAINT IS ESSENTIAL IN THE 
INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC WELLBEING
    I REFER TO STATE BORROWING, AND IN PARTICULAR 
    TO THEIR BORROWING FOR SO-CALLED INFRASTRUCTURE 
    PROJECTS.

IN NOVEMBER 1978, THE COMMONWEALTH AND STATE GOVERNMENTS 
MET IN THE LOAN COUNCIL - THE BODY WHICH APPROVES AND 
COORDINATES THE BORROWING REQUIREMENTS OF ALL GOVERNMENTS 
IN AUSTRALIA - AND APPROVED A NEW BORROWING PROGRAM, 
NOW LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWING 
PROGRAM

                    2.                    CWl

        THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO ASSIST THE 
        FINANCING OF PROJECTS WHICH, IN PARTICULAR 
        WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S . 
        NATIONAL RESOURCES
        AND WHICH COULD NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE NORMAL
        BORROWING PROGRAMS FOR THE STATES AND THEIR 
        AUTHORITIES.

THE MAIN PROJECTS TO HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL UNDER THE 
PROGRAM IN ITS EARLY YEARS HAVE INCLUDED-
    -   NEW ELECTRICITY GENERATION CAPACITY NECESSARY
        FOR THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIAN 
        INDUSTRY
    -   NEW EFFICIENT PORT FACILITIES FOR-LOADING 
        COÂL,FOR EXPORT MARKETS
    -   AND PROJECTS SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
        THE NORTH-WEST SHELF GAS FIELDS.

ON CURRENT COST  ESTIMATES - WITHOUT ALLOWING
FOR INFLATION - IF ALL PROJECTS CURRENTLY APPROVED
UNDER THE PROGRAM WERE FULLY FUNDED BY SPECIAL BORROWINGS, 
OVER $4,000 MILLION EXTRA WOULD BE SOUGHT FROM THE
CAPITAL MARKET BEFORE THE END OF THE DECADE
        AND OVER HALF OF THAT EXTRA BORROWING WOULD.
        OCCUR BEFORE MID 1983 IF PRESENT SCHEDULES 
        PROPOSED BY THE STATES WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

SOME STATES, IN PARTICULAR QUEENSLAND AND NEW SOUTH WALES, 
HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SUBSTANTIAL NEW PROPOSALS, 
MAINLY FOR ACCELERATED INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY

                      3.

CAPACITY, WHICH IF ACCEPTED WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE THE 
TOTAL BORROWING PROGRAM.

THE COMMONWEALTH SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM,
     -   AS MAKING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
         REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA,
     -   AND AS MAKING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO 
         THE PROMOTION OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. 

INDEED THE COMMONWEALTH ITSELF SOUGHT AND RECEIVED 
APPROVAL FOR TWO SMALL PROJECTS REQUIRING BORROWINGS 
OF $132 MILLION.

OUR BASIC ATTITUDE TO THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM HAS NÒT-CHANGED
     -   BUT WE NOW SEE SOME REAL DANGERS IN THE WAY 
         THAT EVENTS ARE UNFOLDING THAT REQUIRE A 
         GREATER DEGREE OF MODERATION, RESPONSIBILITY 
         AND CO-OPERATION THAN SOME STATES HAVE BEEN 
         WILLING TO DEMONSTRATE SO FAR.

THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT A BORROWING PROGRAM OF THE
SIZE, AND WITH THE TIMING THAT SOME STATE PREMIERS ARE  - 
SEEKING WILL DRIVE UP INTEREST RATES, AND LIMIT BORROWING 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT PROJECTS
     -   AND THIS WILL OCCUR EVEN IF SOME BORROWING IS
         UNDERTAKEN OVERSEAS, AS SOME PREMIERS         -
         HAVE PROPOSED.                                -

            4.          CW1

IF ALL THIS EXTRA BORROWING IS FUNDED IN THE DOMESTIC 
CAPITAL MARKET, GOVERNMENTS ARE NECESSARILY IN DIRECT 
COMPETITION WITH PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWINGS, AND THE LIKELY 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR PRIVATE 
PROJECTS AND FOR INTEREST RATES ARE DIRECT AND OBVIOUS.
   - FUNDS FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE REDUCED, 
     AND INTEREST RATES WILL BE INCREASED.

IF BORROWING IS FUNDED FROM OVERSEAS THE EFFECTS ARE 
LESS DIRECT BUT NO LESS REAL
   - THE RESULTING CAPITAL INFLOW WOULD INCREASE 
     THE DOMESTIC MONEY SUPPLY, WOULD REQUIRE 
     RESTRICTION ON DOMESTIC CREDIT AND HENCE 
     WOULD CHOKE OFF THE SUPPLY OF DOMESTIC FUNDS 
     AND-RAISE INTEREST RATES
   - AND IF DOMESTIC CREDIT WERE NOT RESTRICTED, 
     INFLATION WOULD BE GIVEN A BOOST.

THE STATE PREMIERS, PARTICULARLY MR WRAN AND SIR
CHARLES COURT, HAVE FREQUENTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT HIGH 
INTEREST RATES
   - BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PREPARED TO BE CO- 
     OPERATIVE IN MODIFYING OR RESCHEDULING 
     THEIR OWN BORROWING PROGRAMS TO ENABJF 
     PRESSURE TO BE TAKEN OFF THE CAPITAL MARKET
   - INDEED IN SOME CASES THERE IS NOW THE APPEARANCE 
     OF STATES ATTEMPTING TO USE THIS PROGRAM AS 
     A COMPETITIVE MECHANISM TO ATTRACT RESOURCE 
     DEVELOPERS TO THEIR STATE IN PREFERENCE TO OTHERS.

          5.           CLv'1

  - AND PROJECTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR INCLUSION
    IN THE PROGRAM, PARTICULARLY FOR POWER GENERATION,
    WHERE NO NEED HAS BEEN YET ESTABLISHED, AND
    WHERE EVEN THE LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED POWER
    STATIONS IS NOT YET DECIDED.

SOME OF THE PROJECTS FOR WHICH APPROVAL HAS BEEN GIVEN
OR IS BEING SOUGHT COULD, MOREVER, INVOLVE GREATER
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND
FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE
  - THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COAL LOADERS, INCLUDING 
    THAT ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN NEW SOUTH 
    WALES WOULD, I AM SURE, BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE 
    PRIVATE SECTOR
  - AND----IN SOME CASES INVOLVING THE CONSTRUCTION 
    OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION CAPACITY, THE 
    ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IS FOR PARTICULAR BULK 
    USERS: THESE TOO WOULD SEEM EMINENTLY SUITABLE 
    FOR PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.

THE COMMONWEALTH IS NOT SEEKING TO WEAKEN THIS IMPORTANT 
PROGRAM, BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ITS IMPLEMENTATION 
SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE AUSTRALIA`S ECONOMIC RECOVERY
    BY PUTTING UNDUE PRESSURE ON CAPITAL MARKETS
  - BY SUPPORTING. INAPPROPRIATE PROJECTS 
    OR BY COMMITING PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDS WHERE 
    PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDS OR PRIVATE SECTOR 
    INITIATIVES WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE.

                 6.               CW1

    IT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH THAT THIS 
    SPECIAL BORROWING PROGRAM SHOULD RELIEVE ANY GOVERNMENT 
    OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO FUND ITS ACTIVITIES IN AN 
    ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY
      -  IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO SUBSIDISE COMMERCIALLY 
         UNDE S IRABTE PROJECTS
      -  NOR TO PROVIDE A MEANS FOR STATES TO SUBSIDISE 
         PRIVATE SECTOR PROJECTS AT THE TAXPAYERS 
         EXPENSE
      -  FOR LET US BE CLEAR, THE TAXPAYER HAS TO MEET 
         THE COST OF REPAYING THESE LOANS IN THE FUTURE. 

    THE TOTALITY OF BORROWING REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATES
    AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THIS FINANCIAL YEAR I*S SUBSTANTIALLY 
    LARGER THAN THAT OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS AUTHORITIES
      -  AND WHILE THE COMMONWEALTH'S COMPETITION WITH
         THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR LOAN FUNDS HAS BEEN 
         DIMINISHING IN RECENT YEARS THE STATES AND 
         LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INCREASING THEIR 
         COMPETITION FOR THOSE FUNDS.

    THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION IN RELATION TO ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT 
    MUST NOW SHIFT FROM THE COMMONWEALTH'S BORROWINGS
    AND ITS DEFICIT - THOUGH WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE 
    THAT DEFICIT - TO THE STATES AND THEIR-BORROWING 
    REQUIREMENTS.

    AT THE LOAN COUNCIL MEETING IN JUNE WE SHALL BE SEEKING 
    FROM THE STATES GREATER CO-OPERATION, AND A GREATER
    SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, WITH RESPECT TO THEIR

INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWING PROGRAMS
    AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON THEIR 
    ATTITUDES AT THAT MEETING.
