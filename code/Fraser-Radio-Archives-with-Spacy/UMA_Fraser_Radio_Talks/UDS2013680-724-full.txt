PRIME MINISTER'S ELECTORATE TALK
   29 NOVEMBER 1981

THIS YEAR I MADE A JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE VICTORIAN 
PREMIER ANNOUNCING THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WOULD MAKE A 
GIFT OF $5 MILLION TO VICTORIA TO MARK THE 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE HENTYS AT PORTLAND, 
AND THE SETTLEMENT OF MELBOURNE ONE YEAR LATER.

SINCE THE TIME OF THAT ANNOUNCEMENT, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 
HOW THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT HAVE BEEN HELD WITH THE 
VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT

    WHICH IN TURN RECEIVED ADVICE FROM THE 
    CITIZENS' COUNCIL OF VICTORIA'S 150TH 
    ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS, UNDER THE 
    CHAIRMANSHIP OF SIR JOHN HOLLAND.

IT HAS NOW BEEN DECIDED THAT THE $5 MILLION WILL BE 
SPREAD BETWEEN THREE PROJECTS.
THESE PROJECTS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS,

    AND EACH ONE WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS AN 
    ANNIVERSARY PROJECT, FUNDED BY THE 
    COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT AS PART OF ITS 
    CONTRIBUTION TO THE CELEBRATIONS BY THE PEOPLE 
    OF VICTORIA.

ONE OF THE PROJECTS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECOND 
STAGE OF THE WEST GATE PARK.

             2.


THIS PROJECT IS PART OF AN OVERALL PLAN FOR THE YARRA 
AND MARIBYRNONG RIVERS.

IT WILL PROVIDE UNIQUE PARKLAND AND LEISURE FACILITIES, 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE WESTERN 
SUBURBS OF MELBOURNE

  -  AND THERE WILL BE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THE
     DISABLED.

WORK ON STAGE ONE IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY, AND STAGE TWO 
IS ESPECIALLY TIMELY AS IT WILL LEND ITSELF TO FURTHER 
DEVELOPMENT FOR AUSTALIA'S 1988 BICENTENNIAL 
CELEBRATIONS.

THE SECOND PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GALLERY OF 
SPORT ALONG SIMILAR LINES TO THE FAMOUS CENTRE IN LOS 
ANGELES.


THIS PROJECT FOLLOWS UP THE OUTSTANDING SUCCESS OF THE 
CRICKET MUSEUM AT THE MELBOURNE CRICKET CLUB

     WHICH HAS ATTRACTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SINCE 
     ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1969.

             3.

THE GALLERY OF SPORT SHOULD ATTRACT MANY MORE PEOPLE AND 
IT WILL BE A MAJOR TOURIST ATTRACTION.

THE GALLERY OF SPORT WILL BE A MUSEUM AND EDUCATION 
CENTRE FOR ALL SPORTS

  -  AND IT WILL INCORPORATE THE CRICKET MUSEUM.

IT WILL BE ATTACHED TO THE M.C.G., IT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE 
TO THE PUBLIC, AND IT WILL ALSO BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS 
A 150TH ANNIVERSARY PROJECT.


SINCE SPORT IS SO MUCH A PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN WAY OF 
LIFE THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS HIGHLY SUITABLE TO THESE 
150TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS.

THE THIRD PROJECT RELATES TO PLANS BY THE ROYAL 
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY OF VICTORIA TO ESTABLISH AN 
AGRICULTURAL HISTORICAL AND EDUCATIONAL CENTRE AT THE 
SHOWGROUNDS.

FINAL PLANS FOR THIS VENTURE WHICH WOULD DISPLAY A RANGE 
OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN A HISTORICAL AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL CONTEXT, WILL DEPEND ON THE RESULTS OF A 
DETAILED FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN 
COMPLETED.

            4.


THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE THREE 
PROJECTS

  -  WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO THE CONCERNS OF CITY AND 
     COUNTRY PEOPLE

  -  AND WHICH INCORPORATE A SPECIAL SPORTING
     DIMENSION AS WELL

  -  GATHER TOGETHER SOME OF THE MAJOR STRANDS OF
     THE HISTORY AND CHARACTER OF VICTORIA.

I LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMPLETION OF THESE PROJECTS AS A 
FORERUNNER TO A SUCCESSFUL CELEBRATION OF VICTORIA'S 
150TH ANNIVERSARY IN 1984-85, AND I AM DELIGHTED TO 
ANNOUNCE THESE DETAILS OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S 
INVOLVEMENT.
