                                 This week I would like to talk to you about Five 
              Power Defence Arrangements, Rural Reconstruction and Trading
              Relationships with Japan,                                                                              (5-751

                                           FIVE POWER DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS
                                 This week the Minister for Defence and the Minister
              for Foreign Affairs are in London for discussions which are 
              intended to reach the concluding stages of the five power
              defence arrangements between the United Kingdom, Malaysia, 
              Singapore, New Zealand and ourselves, A great deal of progress 
              has been made in these matters over the last eight months and
•             the last questions appeared to have been cleared away by a
              mission lead by Sir Arthur Tange, permanent head of the
              Department of Defence, to Singapore early in January of this
              year
                                 The arrangements that are now being finalised are
              important, They will preserve confidence in the region and
              show that the United Kingdom is still concerned with peace
              and stability in South East Asia,
                                 In the past the British have had an absolute commitment
              for the defence of the Singapore Malaysia region and anything
              we had done had merely been in support of their guarantee,
              For the future the countries have been developing arrangements
              of equal partnership in which there will be an equal respons-
              ibility on all the countries involved,
                                 This is much more appropriate to the present
              circumstances as it is unrealistic to expect the United Kingdom
              to maintain her absolute defence guarantee, The five power
              arrangements are defensive in their character, They do not imply
              any particular international view to any of the five members
              on other matters of major international concern,
                                                                                                      0 0 , 2

        In recent times there have been matters in which 
   Malaysia has sought to emphasise the desirability of neutral 
   stance in international affairs, Such an attitude is entirely 
   compatible with the five power defensive arrangements that 
   are being established,
        I shall only add that the change in attitude by 
   the United Kingdom as a result of the Conservative victory 
   last winter was made possible by the earlier Australian 
   initiative to maintain forces in the area at the request, 
   of course, of Singapore and Malaysia, If we had also made a
•  decision to withdraw our forces entirely as the earlier 
   Wilson Government had done for the United Kingdom and if 
   we had thus indicated our lack of concern with the security 
   of this area, then it would have been quite impossible for 
   the United Kingdom policy to be altered as it has been to 
   every-one's advantage,
             RURAL RECONSTRUCTION
        During the last few days I had discussions with a 
   number concerned with the wool industry and with the Minister 
   for Primary Industry, Ian Sinclair, I expect that the rural 
   reconstruction proposals will be introduced into the Parliament 
   before the end of this Autumn session,
        Indeed, I regard it as essential that they be so
   introduced,
        I know Victoria has already issued forms and many 
   people have made applications, Once the legislation is introduced 
   into the Parliament and the principles attached to the scheme 
   have been more widely known, I will seek maximum publicity for 
   them throughout my own electorate and through the rural

                     3
    organisations in the electorate, I have no doubt there is the 
    greatest possible interest in the way these particular 
    proposals will work,

             TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH JAPAN

          The Government is watching with continued interest 
    and concern the United Kingdom attempt to enter the European 
    Economic Community.
          Whether or not the British join, and if they join 
    the manner of their joining, could have a great impact on
411 Australia, But it could also have an impact much wider
    afield, So far the European Economic Community has been
    selfish and narrow in its trading outlook, It has sought to
    look after its own interests and dis-regard the impact of
    its policies on others,
          This has applied especially to agricultural products.
          If a community enlarged by British membership
    carries on the same selfish outlook the results on world
    trade could be very difficult,
•         Forces of economic isolation in the United States 
    might well be given added incentive, This would have an 
    additional impact on Australia's trade and on Japan's trade, 
    for example,
          The return to the economic nationalism of the 1930s 
    sparked by a selfish economic community would be disastrous 
    for the free world and all countries outside the economic 
    community should direct their attention to see that it does 
    not occur.

     If the European Economic Community is selfish,
countries like Japan, Canada, United States, New Zealand
and Australia would need to examine the desirability of
establishing some kind of Pacific trading partnership. If
we were to do that the partnership would have to embrace within
it principles not only for the advantage of the countries I
have mentioned but also for the advantage of the developing
countries of East and South East Asia in particulars In
these areas Japan and Australia have much in common.
     Japan and Australia are depending on the sophisticated
markets in Europe and the United States to find outlets for
their high Quality consumer goods. Their rising standard of
living depends on their ability to trade, Our standards also
depend on our ability to trade, but largely in different
commodities.
     Both Japan and Australia would be disadvantaged by
a restrictive trading community in Europe. There is advantage
to both of us in working for a free flow of international
trade.
     Where there is an identity of interest of this kind
we should work closely together to achieve our common
purposes.
