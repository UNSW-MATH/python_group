THE STATEMENTS BY MR HAYDEN AND MR CAIN OVER THE LAST 
WEEK ON BANNING NUCLEAR ARMED SHIPS FROM AUSTRALIAN PORTS 
HAS STRUCK AT THE HEART OF A BASIC RESPONSIBILITY WHICH 
THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ENTRUSTED TO THE COMMONWEALTH 
GOVERNMENT

    THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.

WHEN MR CAIN ANNOUNCED THAT THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT 
PERMIT NUCLEAR ARMED SHIPS TO VISIT VICTORIAN PORTS, MR CAIN 
WAS SEEKING TO PUT IN PLACE A PART OF HIS PARTY'S PUBLICLY 
DECLARED POLICY,

MR CAIN SHALL NOT SUCCEED IN GIVING EFFECT TO THIS MEASURE 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY REFLECTS THE SOCIALIST LEFT'S POWER,

THE COMMONWEALTH HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY IN SUCH 
MATTERS.

THE COMMONWEALTH ATTORNEY-GENERAL WILL RECOMMEND THE INTRODUCTION 
OF LEGISLATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT (QUITE CLEAR
THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE LEGAL BACKING FOR THE COMMONWEALTH'S 
RESPONSIBILITY IN DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY.

HOWEVER, MR HAYDEN'S SUPPORT FOR MR CAIN'S POSITION

  - THE FEDERAL LABOR LEADER'S DECLARED OPPOSITION
    TO ENTRY INTO AUSTRALIAN PORTS OF SHIPS CARRYING 
    NUCLEAR WEAPONS

         2.

    HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF THE 
    NATION AND RAISES SEVERAL IMPORTANT ISSUES.

IS MR HAYDEN GOING TO LET MR CAIN AND THE SOCIALIST LEFT 
DETERMINE LABOR POLICY

    ESPECIALLY ON SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE?

HOW CAN AUSTRALIA CONTRIBUTE TO, OR EVEN REMAIN IN THE 
ANZUS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AND NEW ZEALAND 
IF ALL U.S, NAVAL VESSELS ARE BARRED FROM OUR PORTS?

FOR THAT IS WHAT MR HAYDEN WOULD DO.

NO NATION WITH NUCLEAR ARMS CAN SAY WHICH OF ITS SHIPS 
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

    IF IT DID, IT WOULD BE PROVIDING VITAL INFORMATION 
    ABOUT THE STRENGTHS OF THEIR OPPONENTS' SHIPS TO 
    POTENTIAL ENEMIES.

MR WHITLAM PUT FORWARD THIS SAME ARGUMENT IN 1976,

THEREFORE, MR HAYDEN WOULD BE BANNING NOT ONLY ALL U.S, 
WARSHIPS BUT ALSO THOSE OF BRITAIN AND FRANCE.

OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES OFTEN HAVE NAVAL VESSELS IN OUR 
PORTS.

                         3,

THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 500 VISITS FROM BRITISH, AN ERICAN
AND FRENCH NAVIES OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS

          ONE SHIP A WEEK, ON AVERAGE,

IF WE ARE TO PRESERVE OUR FRIENDSHIPS AND ALLIANCES, THEN 
WE HAVE TO FULFIL OUR OBLIGATIONS

          AND SURELY THE LOST FUNDAMENTAL IS THE PROVISION 
          OF PORTS AND PORT FACILITIES,

DENYING THOSE FACILITIES IS A DENIAL OF OUR TREATY 
UNDERTAKINGS AND UNDERSTANDINGS,

DO THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY NR CAIN AND VR HAYDEN MERELY 
REFLECT AN IRRESPONSIBLE AND CARELESS APPROACH TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY?

ARE THEY THE SHORT-SIGHTED POSITIONS BORN OF A DISREGARD 
FOR LONG TERM NATIONAL INTERESTS AND OF THE UNEXPECTED 
SHORT TERM STORM CLOUDS THAT CAN LEAP INTO TODAY'S 
APPARENTLY CLEAR BLUE SKY?

OR ARE THEY PART OF A DELIBERATE AND PLANNED LABOR SCHEME 
TO ENGINEER A BASIC SHIFT IN AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE AND 
FOREIGN POLICY?

             4,

WHY HAS MR CAIN, FOLLOWED BY MR HAYDEN, DECLARED THAT LABOR 
WOULD BAN THE UNITED STATES NAVY FROM AUSTRALIAN PORTS ONLY 
A FEW DAYS BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S ANZUS COUNCIL MEETING IN 
AUSTRALIA?

IS THERE A PATTERN EMERGING, A PROGRESSION OF DECLARATIONS 
AND ARGUMENTS DEVELOPING AS MR HAYDEN SEEKS TO ADVANCE LABOR 
POLICIES?

IS MR HAYDEN'S ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
NUCLEAR ARMED SHIPS AND NUCLEAR ARMED AIRCRAFT PART OF 
THAT PROGRESSION?

THE GOVERNMENT REOUIRES PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND AGREEMENT OF 
FLIGHTS OVER AND THROUGH AUSTRALIA BY NUCLEAR ARMED AIRCRAFT,

HOWEVER, THERE IS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A B-52 FLYING 
FROM OR THROUGH AUSTRALIA ON A SPECIFIC VISSION AND A SHIP 
SEEKING SUPPLIES AND RECREATION FOR ITS CREW AFTER WEEKS AND 
MONTHS ON DUTY AT SEA,

MR HAYDEN MUST KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS 
SUPPORT OUR AMERICAN ALLIANCE,

ARE THESE DECLARATIONS AND ARGUMENTS THE LABOR WAY TO DESTROY 
ANZUS BY MAKING AUSTRALIA NO LONGER A WORTHWHILE PARTNER?

              5,


NEXT MONTH THE ALP'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE WILL CONSIDER A 
MOTION TO REPLACE THE SECTION ON CO-OPERATION IN ANZUS WITH 
ONE CALLING FOR "AN INDEPENDENT AND NON-ALIGNED FOREIGN 
POLICY" FOR AUSTRALIA?

"NON-ALIGNED" WITH WHOM?

THERE ARE A RANGE OF NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD DECLARING 
THEIR NON-ALIGNED STATUS BUT HOW NON-ALIGNED ARE THEY?

IT WAS THE SOCIALIST LEFT FACTION IN VICTORIA WHO SUCCESSFULLY 
PILOTED THROUGH THE VICTORIAN ALP CONFERENCE TO THE NATIONAL 
CONFERENCE THEIR MOTION TO EFFECTIVELY END THE ANZUS
ALLIANCE AND PROMOTE A NON-ALIGNED AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY,

WHAT DO THE SOCIALIST LEFT MEAN BY NON-ALIGNED?

WHAT DOES NR CAIN MEAN?

WHERE DOES MR HAYDEN STAND?

     FOR WE MUST ASSUME HE MEANS WHAT HE SAYS,

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EVENTS OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, THESE 
QUESTIONS DEMAND CLEAR AND URGENT ANSWERS.
