 Leader of the Opposition
 MEMBER FOR WANNON
               ELECTORAL TALK
                               FOR SUNDAY 3 AUGUST 
                               FOR THURSDAY 7 AUGUST

ONE OF THE HOLLOWEST PROMISES MADE DURING THE 1972 AND 1974 
CAMPAIGNS WAS MADE BY THE LABOR PARTY ABOUT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.

IT PROMISED AN ERA OF HARMONY BASED ON THE SUPPOSED GOOD 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS MR BOB HAWKE.

WITH SUCH A NOTORIOUSLY SHAKY BASIS IT IS NO WONDER THAT THERE 
IS RECORD INDUSTRIAL UNREST.

THIS UNREST HAS NOT BEEN IN THE INTEREST OF THE WORK FORCE, 
OF INDUSTRY OR OF THE NATION.

STRIKES HAVE MADE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE COST PRESSURES 
WHICH HAVE HAD SUCH A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY 
OF BUSINESSES, AND THEREFORE ON JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND 
EMPLOYMENT.

STRIKES HAVE PLAYED THEIR PART IN THE DISRUPTION OF THE 
BUILDING INDUSTRY. BANS AND BOYCOTTS HAVE BEEN USED TO PREVENT 
EXPORT OF LIVESTOCK, AND OF WHEAT.

  PART OF THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL UNREST LIES 
  IN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC SITUATION.

  INFLATION MUST BE OVERCOME AND PROSPERITY RESTORED TO THE 
  ECONOMY.

  BUT THERE MUST ALSO BE A FRAMEWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
  WHICH IS APPROPRIATE FOR MODERN TIMES AND WHICH SETS OUT THE
• RULES IN A CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER.

  THE OPPOSITION PARTIES STAND FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF FULL 
  EMPLOYMENT, ALTHOUGH IT HAS TO BE ADMITTED THAT THE EVENTS 
  OF THE PAST 2 1/2 YEARS HAS MADE THIS TASK A GREATER ONE 
  THAN IT USED TO BE.

  AMONG THE REFORMS WHICH WILL BE SUPPORTED ARE PORTABILITY OF 
  LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND SUPERANNUATION AND IMPROVED RETRAINING 
• AND JOB FINDING SCHEMES.
  A LIBERAL NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE 
  GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING AND THE RELOCATION OF 
  UNEMPLOYED PERSONS AND PROGRAMMES OF RELIEF WORK TO BE 
  ADMINISTERED AT LOCAL LEVEL.

  OUR AIM IS TO PRESERVE HUMAN DIGNITY AND PERSONAL LIVING 
  STANDARDS.

               -3-

   WHILE RECOGNISING THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO REFUSE TO JOIN 
    UNIONS IT WOULD BE OUR POLICY TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES AND 
   EMPLOYERS BOTH TO TAKE A RESPONSIBLE AND ACTIVE PART IN 
   THEIR TRADE UNION OR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

   WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNIONISM IS BASIC TO THE AUSTRALIAN WAY 
   OF LIFE AND IN THE LAST RESORT IT IS THE RECOGNISED RIGHT OF 
   AN EMPLOYEE TO WITHDRAW HIS LABOUR IN AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE.
•  SO LONG AS THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION 
   ACT HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH.

   WE WOULD SEEK TO WORK WITH THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE 
   UNIONS TO ENCOURAGE THE FORMATION OF INDUSTRY BASED UNIONS 
   WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND LIKELYHOOD 
   OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES.

   WE WILL PROVIDE FOR SECRET BALLOTS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF 
   THE COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL OFFICE FOR UNION ELECTIONS, THE 
   COST OF WHICH WILL BE MET BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   THE NATIONAL LABOUR ADVISORY COUNCIL WOULD BE REVIVED AS THE 
   PRINCIPLE PRIVATE FORUM AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
   ADVICE FROM BOTH TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS.

   WE BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED 
   TO SETTLE THEIR INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES VOLUNTARILY AND FREELY 
   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION 
   ACT.

                -4-
   THEY WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO INCORPORATE DISPUTE SETTLING 
   PROCEDURES IN THEIR AGREEMENTS AND AWARDS.

   ARBITRATION SHOULD BE USED TO SETTLE DISPUTES WHERE THE 
   PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO REACH FULL AGREEMENT BY VOLUNTARY 
   NEGOTIATION AND CONCILIATION.

   THERE MUST BE DUE REGARD TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE 
~  NEGOTIATION OF AGREEMENTS AND IN ARBITRATED AWARDS.
   INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS AND AWARDS, SHOULD BE OBSERVED AND THE 
   LAW MUST GIVE ITS SUPPORT.

   RULES ARE DESIGNED SO THAT RIGHT PREVAILS. WITHOUT REASONABLE 
   RULES IT IS THE STRONGEST WHICH PREVAILS AND THIS IS INTOLERABLE 
   IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. NOW SHOULD SO VITAL AN AREA AS 
   INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BE EXEMPT FROM THE GENERAL PRESCRIPTION 
   THAT BREACHES CARRY CONSEQUENCES.
•  WE WOULD ESTABLISH AN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUREAU AS A THIRD 
   ARM OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ADMINISTRATION, 
   TO ENSURE THAT INDUSTRIAL LAW IS OBSERVED.

   IT WOULD BE GIVEN THE TASK OF DETERMINING THE FACTS WHERE 
   THERE HAD BEEN BREACHES OF INDUSTRIAL LAW, AND OF 
   PRESENTING THOSE FACTS TO THE INDUSTRIAL COURT.

                -5-

    INDUSTRIAL LAW WILL BE APPLIED EQUALLY TO EMPLOYER AND 
    EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS AND BOTH WILL BE CONSULTED IN THE 
    DETAILED IMPLICATIONS OF THESE PROPOSALS. EMPLOYERS AND 
    EMPLOYEES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO THE 
    COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

    THEIR RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE SEEN AS A DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIP, 
    AND ONCE AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED THEN BOTH SIDES HAVE 
    AN OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH AND HONOUR THAT AGREEMENT.
~   THE VIEW THAT INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE THE ONLY LEGAL 
    AGREEMENT WHICH ARE BINDING ON ONE PARTY AND NOT THE OTHER 
    IS CONTRARY TO OUR PHILOSOPHY, CONTRARY TO LAW AND CONTRARY 
    TO THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.
