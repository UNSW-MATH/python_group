                                                                                              STATE ELECTIONS


                                               On April 29th, the state of Victoria will be going to
                    the elections to decide what Government it wants for the next
                    three years.
                                               The Bolte Government has given Victoria a period of
                    stability which has made it possible for this state to progress
                    much faster than was previously the case.
                                               I think many of us have now almost forgotten the changes
                    of Government, the instability and the lack of progress that was
                    so evident in the period before the Bolte Government took office.
                                               It is only necessary to look at the records to see what
                    the position was. In the years since then, however, there has
                    been a great deal of progress throughout the state of Victoria and
                    in these recent years Western Victoria has really began to move.
                                               Portland is developing in a manner that few people thought
                    possible 10 or 15 years ago. The town is expanding as an
                    industrial and commercial centre and new facilities are being
                    established which will do a great deal to assist the farmers and
                    producers of this area.
                                               I am not saying that the Government is responsible for all
                    of these things, but it is responsible for establishing the
                    circumstances in which these developments could take place.
                                               However, my purpose is not to talk State Politics because
                    the State Politicians are quite capable of doing this for themselves
                    and they are responsible for their own policies, but I do want to
                    talk to you about a man whom I have known for a long time and who
                    is standing for the new seat of Portland.
                                               This is Don McKellar.
                                               I have the greatest respect for his sincerity and for the
                    hard and conscientious manner in which he goes about his job.

             2.

    Since he was chosen as Liberal candidate for Portland, 
he has spent a great deal of time travelling about the electorate 
getting to know as many people as possible.
    He has lived in the Hamilton district all his life, was 
educated in Hamilton, he is an active primary producer and lives 
at Yulecart, which is in the new Portland electorate. He is 42 
years old, married and has 5 children. For 4 years he was a 
councillor of the Dundas shire and through the last war he
served overseas for 3 years with the Royal Australian Air Force.
    I believe Don McKellar is one of the people who should 
be in Parliament because of the kind of person he is. I have no 
doubt that he will work for your interests and for the interests 
of the electorate.
    I know if you give him the support that I hope you will 
that he will regard himself as a representative for all the people 
of his electorate as I regard myself a representative for all the 
people in `Vannon. In these terms it means that he represents you 
whatever your politics may be, but he can't do that unless he has 
sufficient support on 29 April.
    I am quite sure that if Don McKellar is elected as I 
believe he will be as the state member for Portland, that you will 
not regret your choice.
