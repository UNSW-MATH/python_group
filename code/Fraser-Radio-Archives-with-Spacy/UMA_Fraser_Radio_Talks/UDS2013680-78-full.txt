MESS STATEMENT: 

 MALCOLM FRASER:

                                            August 12th, 1962


          During the winter recess two things of major importance have 
 been constantly in the news, The first of these is, of course, the 
Common Market with its implications for the United Kingdom, for Australia 
and for the Commonwealth of Nations. The second has been the vexed New 
Guinea issue.

                        WEST NEW GUINEA

          A few words about this issue first. Negotiations held in 
part under the auspices of the United Nations, and in part under the 
auspices of the United States, have been proceeding from time to time. 
These negotiations have been clouded by guerilla type action of the
Indonesians. However, it appears that the great powers who could effect 
the result of this issue are resigned to Indonesia gaining possession of 
West New Guinea. It appears that the great powers would even weloome this, 
perhaps because there are many who believe it would remove a thorn from the 
side of the Indonesians and make it possible for them to get down and concern 
themselves with their domestic affairs which certainly need attention.

          There is no doubt that the Communist Party in Indonesia has 
continually been able to use the West New Guinea issue to keep up anti_ 
colonial and anti western propaganda in Indonesia generally, If the West 
New Guinea problem is solved the Indonesian Communist Party's greatest 
propaganda weapon would be put to rest.

          Australia has quite rightly been concerned. There may be a 
real imperialist move in Indonesia which would cause that country to request 
the whole of New Guinea after it had obtained West New Guinea. Nobody can 
categorically say there is no risk of this happening. However, there is a 
good chance that it would not happen because the history of the two parts of 
New Guinea are quite different, and if my information is correct an 
Indonesian Sultan, before the days of Dutch rule, had some kind of suzerainty 
over West New Guinea, but not over East New Guinea. It was on the basis of 
this suzerainty that the Dutch claimed West New Guinea as being part of their 
empire. This is one of the reasons why the Indonesians feel that they were 
cheated when the Dutch did not hand West New Guinea over to them in 1949/50 
when they ceded the rest of their territory to Indonesia.

          What Australia can do in this kind of dispute is clearly limited 
by our own resources and power. The efforts of the Australian Government 
therefore have consequently been directed towards achieving a peaceful and 
lawfúl solution to the problem. If this is to happen it will be necessary 
to obtain a solution which would appear to avoid loss of face either for 
 the Indonesians or for the Dutch.

          There may be more to say about this issue later on.

not be forced to choose between the Common Narket and the Commonwealth, so 
+hat the political advantage of which have spoken can be achieved with the 
export industries of Australia, New Zealand and Canada being greviously hit. 
However, it is still too early to say what will finally happen or how high
the price may be. If the United Kingdom does join, and if there is an 
economic price to pay which, despite the efforts of the Australian Govern- 
ment there probably would be, any industries affected should not be asked 
to carry the burden alone - the burden of transitional arrangements which 
any industry might have to undergo should be carried by Australia as a whole. 
However, it is still too early to work out such matters. We don't yet know 
for certain if Britain is going to join We don't know what the price would 
be. We don't know what industries would be affected and we won't know 
until we are told the final terms of entry.
